2010-06-07 00:26:09	codebrainz	xeon-enouf, i think cluster to ms is an amount of sectors, to which there is a certain number of bytes in each.  i think

2010-06-07 00:26:35	Meshezabeel	thanks xeon-enouf
2010-06-07 00:26:35	mordy	sysstat is a metapackage

2010-06-07 00:27:16	xeon-enouf	Meshezabeel: and remember vfat and fat32 aren't (exactly) identical - but for all intents and purposes they are
2010-06-07 00:27:20	dbbolton	i can't boot from my harddrive. the kernel panics because VFS can open the root device. i don't have an initrd but i but built in the drivers for my IDE controller and filesystems. any suggestions?
2010-06-07 00:27:21	codebrainz	xeon-enouf, well the first word in a fat32 partition boot record is BytesPerSector, the next byte is SectorsPerCluster
2010-06-07 00:27:28	sauvin	codebrainz, yes. A certain number of byte per sector, a certain number of sectors per cluster, and it depends largely on the size of the partition you're putting the FAT fs on, and which kind of FAT.
2010-06-07 00:27:41	[R]	dbbolton: what is the exact error?

I understand that the most conventional ways to deal with metadata are: encode it somehow in tree structure and filenames; stick it somewhere in the file itself; and write it out in a separate, informally related file. I think these are cramped solutions; I wonder if anyone does differently.

Actually, to empty an egg (in case you want an intact eggshell), you puncture both ends and blow the contents out; but this is called "sucking". The maxim just means not to try to instruct your betters. I said I didn't mean to do so.

2010-08-27 21:04:47	dTal	the UNIX filesystem itself is a sort of of namespacing tag setup

2010-08-27 21:17:37	xiong	sed`, Correct me if I'm wrong; I really am still learning the shell: It seems to me that an OFM can easily refactor an arbitrary command typed in by user. For instance, he might type 'prove #jam', where 'prove' is an arbitrary (unaware) command and '#jam' specifies a tag.

2010-08-27 21:24:17	scampbell	xiong: still, we either have to search some set of files for that tag or we have to have already indexed them someplace.  either way, it's a hit.

2010-08-27 21:33:42	scampbell	xiong: I would consider using pretty much any database with the file path as the major key, but, again, i'm thinking performance.
2010-08-27 21:34:09	Tramp	xiong: given that your tests are sorted by some other (primary) criteria in the filesystem, some people would solve your "second criteria problem" with symlinks, I think. It's the classical librarian's dilemma
2010-08-27 21:34:19	scampbell	it would be a pretty simple app/script to fire off the queries so it could be embedded in commands using command expansion.
2010-08-27 21:34:21	xiong	One might store all metadata for an entire filesystem in some central DB. That's probably bad, although I wouldn't pretend to say so for sure. It just smells bad to me.
2010-08-27 21:34:30	scampbell	Of course, even that has limits, command lines can only be so long.
2010-08-27 21:34:41	sed`	scampbell: one could cache the xattrs in a lightweight database like sqlite or just use only a database in the first place
2010-08-27 21:35:01	scampbell	It's bad to me too because it's not really tied to the file.  Replace/delete the file and we've lost integrity.
2010-08-27 21:35:08	xiong	Tramp, Agreed: Librarian's dilemma. The rough -- very rough -- consensus solution to this is tags.
2010-08-27 21:35:25	xiong	I've tried symlinking and I agree, it's a powerful technique.
2010-08-27 21:35:37	scampbell	Yeah, you could embed a unique key in an XFS extended attribute as the sanity check between the db and filesystem.  Danged messy though.
2010-08-27 21:36:24	xiong	scampbell, I understand; you want the metadata to be stored somehow right in the file, or very near it. To a point, I agree.
2010-08-27 21:36:37	scampbell	For my video collection I have a script that goes through all the various disks and machines and builds a symlink tree that puts things in a convienent form for me but I wouldn't offer it up as stable for anyone but me :)
2010-08-27 21:36:49	Tramp	then you cache this metadata, then you have all the typical problems with cache consistency

2010-08-27 22:59:24	mordy	as raid5 is like raid0 with an extra disk for parity

2010-08-27 23:00:02	butterball	dschuett: have you check your log files yet?
2010-08-27 23:00:06	Psi-Jack	Actually, it's really 75%, disincluding the spare(s). The factor flan_suse's not including is the actual formatable storage of the disks. 1TB actually becomes 960 GB or so.
2010-08-27 23:00:07	mordy	dschuett: check dmesg and the squid error log too
2010-08-27 23:00:17	flan_suse	mordy, the parity is the size of a single disk in the array, spread out evenly on all disks. So RAID-5 is basically size of each disk x 1 minus total number of disks.
2010-08-27 23:00:27	Ratrophy	actually you have no clue
2010-08-27 23:00:31	mordy	you need to set the visible_hostname parameter in squid too (whcih i think is a quirk.. it should at least autodetect if not specified)
2010-08-27 23:00:37	mordy	flan_suse: yep
2010-08-27 23:00:55	mordy	so (i think) in theory you could do 20 disks raid5 and have 19 usable disks
2010-08-27 23:01:00	mordy	with raid6 it's 18 usable disks..

2010-08-27 23:30:09	scampbell	I think I'll wait to see how long it takes them to make a dependable port of ZFS.
2010-08-27 23:30:09	Ratrophy	seeing how Solaris hasn't had a release since oracle took over, it was planned but that was jacked up

2010-08-28 00:04:16	mordy	well.. my thing isn't a gateway really
2010-08-28 00:04:47	mordy	in the sense that i have my own protocol, and that protocol is more like a purple 'RPC' than anything else
2010-08-28 00:05:48	mordy	the idea is that i'd be able to log into my yahoo account from multiple places by connecting to my proxy.. and that i'd have more functionality using my own client than by using something like bitlbee, which limits you to whatever IRC supports
2010-08-28 00:05:49	inode33	Ok, so you sit down in front of your computer and you use yobot to talk to fred and bob at the same time on different protocols?
