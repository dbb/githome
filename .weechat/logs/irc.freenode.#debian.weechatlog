2010-04-18 16:55:43	mirak	wols_, can I declare the harddrive my system is running on as a part of raid1 array then reboot on it and add another device to complete the mirroring ? I know doing that can't be done with partitions because it will break the file system.
2010-04-18 16:55:56	abrotman	dbbolton: what else have you updated recently ?
2010-04-18 16:56:01	d3x	i have built 2.6.34-rc4 .deb with make-kpkg --initrd kernel_package, but after installation i have no initrd. what could have i done wrong?

2010-04-18 16:57:21	wols_	abrotman: he should have googled the error. pretty much everywhere it's a "wlan button pressed. wlan is now off" issue
2010-04-18 16:57:32	wols_	to be checked with rfkill

2010-04-22 22:25:49	SerajewelKS	JairunCaloth: right.  so call from rc.local as you said.  i was just showing you that you don't have to do any sort of detection as to which drive is which.  let udev do that for you.
2010-04-22 22:25:53	dondelelcaro	dbbolton: for example, I have it in ~/texmf (technically a link to ~/lib/texmf), and I've run mktexlsr to build the lsr files for it

2010-04-23 01:26:15	Samus_Aran	do make sure to reboot, or if you try to compile a kernel module, it will be building it for the wrong kernel version.
2010-04-23 01:26:27	Samus_Aran	uname -r should be the kernel you have installed
2010-04-23 01:26:31	elik	yup, back on its feet again
2010-04-23 01:26:37	elik	recompiled my nvidia drivers and all
2010-04-23 01:26:54	elik	and I'm removing the trunk image just to avoid confusion
2010-04-23 01:27:39	elik	so far, grub had always given me the "best" option on boot, but trunk got me sort of stuck on a "local maximum"
2010-04-23 01:29:05	elik	oh well, I guess I had a little bit of troubles coming my way, being on testing :)

2010-04-24 12:46:22	rudi_s	Hi. I'm looking for a test program similar to python's doc test but for the shell. I give it a file with the following content "> echo hi\nhi" (\n is a real newline) and the check passes while "> echo hi\nho" fails (> is the prompt). Does anything like this exist? Thanks.

2010-04-25 19:43:04	PinkFreud	If it failed once out of, say, 10 boots, then that means there is an issue which will cause it to fail 1/10 of the time (assuming that ratio holds)
2010-04-25 19:43:13	PinkFreud	In that case, yes, it is likely to be a race condition.

2010-04-25 20:01:51	PinkFreud	yes, now I would have to endeavor to create a 2.6.31 kernel package, make sure the fglrx and virtualbox drivers are created for it, test it, and hope it doesn't have any issues.
2010-04-25 20:02:05	PinkFreud	or, I could just go with ubuntu, and save myself the trouble.

2010-04-25 20:02:26	cantido	which could turn out to have the same issue
2010-04-25 20:03:25	greg__	hey guys
2010-04-25 20:03:26	PinkFreud	believe me - I'd rather use lenny.  lenny has been fighting me every step of the way, though - first the audio didn't work in 2.6.26.  Then it was the X.org radeon driver.  lenny's fglrx took one look at the video card and declared it had no idea what I wanted it to do.
2010-04-25 20:03:45	PinkFreud	And now this.
2010-04-25 20:04:00	cantido	You did read the bit where it said "no warranty"?
2010-04-25 20:04:22	PinkFreud	cantido: Shockingly, I've been using debian for a few years.  Yes, I've read it many times.
2010-04-25 20:04:27	pipeline	fglrx is terrible
2010-04-25 20:04:32	pipeline	buy new hardware

2010-04-25 20:05:06	PinkFreud	pipeline: Again, lenny's radeon *and* fglrx drivers are too old to support the radeon hd 4200 in here.
2010-04-25 20:05:12	PinkFreud	this IS new hardware.
2010-04-25 20:05:27	cantido	shock! old software cant drive new hardware

2010-04-25 20:05:42	PinkFreud	but that would be because karmic is newer than lenny.

2010-04-25 20:08:47	PinkFreud	this is a build for a family member, so I'm looking for a stable system, not a hack where I maintain custom kernels, etc.

2010-04-25 20:17:39	abrotman	for some cards

2010-04-26 19:50:33	pipeline	Chris___: opera, mozilla, firefox all have javascript things that will replace flash applets with a big "play" button, so that flash doesn't have to be loaded unless you REALLY want to see something.

2010-04-26 19:51:13	Aft3rglow	ok, ignoring preseeding totally for a second. Why is it when I PXE boot into the installer I answer the first few questions and then it says bad mirror without even asking me? this is with no preseed.cfg at all
2010-04-26 19:51:43	SerajewelKS	Chris___: i used to use pandora.  now i have an icecast+mpd setup so i can listen to my own music from anywhere with just vlc or something

You should have a sound knowledge of Debian packaging to use testing and should be prepared for a bumpy ride at times.  Don't use it on things that are critical or on servers.

2010-05-02 03:57:18	wols	umarzuki: read only while trying to copy?
2010-05-02 03:57:27	Vasistha	umarzuki: if you type 'mount' without any parameters it should give you some information about it
2010-05-02 03:57:33	umarzuki	wols: yes, even rsync
2010-05-02 03:57:37	shylent	amine: www.nagios.org obviously
2010-05-02 03:57:52	wols	umarzuki: that's now what I asked. is it suddenly going read only while written to?
2010-05-02 03:58:07	shylent	amine: nagios is one of the most obvious and straightforward things to configure

2010-05-02 04:10:25	shylent	what does ubuntu do to their packages anyway?

2010-05-07 21:21:35	courpse	Thats a different way of saying it.
2010-05-07 21:21:50	courpse	Maybe its time to learn CLI if your wanting to admin a server?
2010-05-07 21:21:59	dondelelcaro	JohnA1: that's fine, but you'll be severly limited without learning how to use the command line

2010-05-07 22:06:31	CutMeOwnThroat	!usb install
2010-05-07 22:06:32	dpkg	Yes, it is possible to install Debian from a USB stick/thumbdrive/pen drive/key, as long as your system's BIOS can boot from USB.  Details are in the Installation Guide, see http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/ch04s03 .  To download USB stick images, ask me about <install debian>. https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download to prepare from Windows.  BIOS can't boot from USB?  Use http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html
2010-05-07 22:06:34	kwame	what I did is download boot.img.gz, did a zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sdb (sdb is my usb device

To paste e.g. your sources.list do "aptitude install pastebinit; pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list" ; to paste the output of a program do e.g. "dmesg | pastebinit".  Default pastebin is currently broken, use e.g. "pastebinit -b http://paste.debian.net/"

2010-05-08 01:34:59	SerajewelKS	running postfix also lets me do cool things... like instead of just automatically trashing mail from people i don't want to correspond with (being a wikipedia admin puts you on some peoples' bad side...) but now i can return a nice "554 Go away.  I don't want to talk to you anymore." to them, which will generate a nifty little bounce message.  :)

2010-05-08 05:20:52	dpkg	hmm... aptitude is a terminal-based package manager that can be used in a command-line mode (aptitude install foo ; aptitude remove goo) as well as a text user interface mode (just run "aptitude").  Ask me about <why aptitude> <why not aptitude> <aptitude-fu> or see http://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude
2010-05-08 05:21:20	wade	more of a shortcut' then a full blown interface
2010-05-08 05:21:50	wade	so i can type  inst <package> and it will install, instead of sudo apt-get install <pacakge>

2010-05-08 05:23:26	wade	and made a nice one that removes pacakge, its settings, then does a autoremove, and removes -those- dependinces settings
2010-05-08 05:23:37	Gunni	that's purge, right?

2010-05-13 12:29:21	greedo	this was more a generic type question

2010-05-13 12:30:11	SerajewelKS	greedo: if you mean to multicast image several machines' hard disks at once, i've used a livecd for this in the past, let me look it up...
2010-05-13 12:30:12	greedo	symantec ghost does not currently ext4 or grub 2
2010-05-13 12:30:16	napster	themill, Eh? can you get me a link?
2010-05-13 12:30:21	themill	!policy
2010-05-13 12:30:22	dpkg	i guess policy is the document that defines how Debian packages should (and must!) interact with each other and with the user to make sure we have a high-quality, stable distribution.  You can find it at http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ or in the debian-policy package.  Those who fail to understand Debian Policy are doomed to reimplement it, poorly.  See also <best practices> <nmg> <mentors>.

2010-05-13 12:31:14	SerajewelKS	greedo: this tool does raw disk images.  i could care less what the filesystem is.  (but it does optimize for some file systems that it understands so that images are sparse.)

2010-05-20 23:45:32	Rusty1	perhaps simply looking at what other resource contentions are happening, htop etc
2010-05-20 23:45:32	karlpinc	wahz: Same results?
2010-05-20 23:45:40	wahz	yes..

2010-05-20 23:46:17	Funar	so karlpinc, you have no idea how to load the driver for my wireless dongle DURING the installation?
2010-05-20 23:46:20	thepro4e1er	is there a j2ee package that i can install on debian?
2010-05-20 23:46:29	NoCode	Weird maybe some servers went offline or something, I can't install vlc
2010-05-20 23:46:42	NoCode	I haven't had updates, or upgrades in Squeeze in a LONG time
2010-05-20 23:46:44	wahz	the weird thing is, almost all other distro's I've tried in the past couple of weeks have similar results with debian
2010-05-20 23:46:48	simonrvn	wow
2010-05-20 23:46:48	karlpinc	Funar: No.  You told me there isn't one. I've no idea how to use ndiswrapper during installation.
2010-05-20 23:46:50	simonrvn	wahz: disk i/o?
2010-05-20 23:47:00	wahz	the only one with the same results as ubuntu is mint (which is really ubuntu anyway)
2010-05-20 23:47:09	wahz	no disk i/o
2010-05-20 23:47:30	simonrvn	compiler version?

2010-05-20 23:48:07	simonrvn	for the kernel; same modules loaded?
2010-05-20 23:48:09	wahz	so the situation I've got is: debian/fedora/arch/slack/gentoo --> 1.8x slower then ubuntu/mint

2010-05-20 23:48:56	karlpinc	Funar: You probably want a minimal install and then manually install, say, xorg and gnome/whatever else you want.
2010-05-20 23:48:58	simonrvn	glibc same?
2010-05-20 23:49:40	simonrvn	ok, how about this, what's different, and did you not check it yet? (makes it easier on both of us ;)

2010-05-20 23:50:23	simonrvn	np
2010-05-20 23:50:41	karlpinc	Funar: There may also be a way to use ndiswrapper at installation, but somebody else will have to help.

2010-05-20 23:51:16	Funar	well becaues no one else is currently stepping in
2010-05-20 23:51:23	Funar	'business card' installation is what i want right
2010-05-20 23:51:26	nsadmin	so you used java to measure java performance
2010-05-20 23:51:30	nsadmin	interesting :)

2010-05-20 23:52:21	wahz	so no, I did not check glibc versions - would it have a big effect in this case?
2010-05-20 23:52:27	nsadmin	it might
2010-05-20 23:52:34	simonrvn	esp. version, what sort of build environment, stuff like that
2010-05-20 23:52:53	nsadmin	but it's unknown at this point since you're not saying what versions
2010-05-20 23:53:08	wahz	one moment...
2010-05-20 23:53:13	simonrvn	you're counting milliseconds right? it would.

2010-05-20 23:53:58	nsadmin	why not use the kernels that come with their respective dists, since they're prepared for those versions
2010-05-20 23:54:01	wahz	sorry, i won't be able to give glibc versions, but i can say that it was whatever is the 'default' on squeeze, and ubuntu
2010-05-20 23:54:06	wahz	both installed in the past week
2010-05-20 23:54:15	nsadmin	which ubuntu?
2010-05-20 23:54:18	simonrvn	nsadmin: indeed (using itself to measure its own performance)
2010-05-20 23:54:51	nsadmin	well you have to have the thing you're testing in java

2010-05-20 23:57:04	nsadmin	I'm not sure... since running a java prog means pulling in the java runtime every time, you'd have to subtract that time which could be different subsequent times due to caching
2010-05-20 23:57:08	Funar	but i dont think it is included

2010-06-17 13:54:54	WormFood	jack_guru, there are several different ways to update the bios, depending on your motherboard. Many modern motherboards have a bios update feature built into the bios. Most likely your .exe is just a self-extracting .zip or .rar format file, but it may be an installer. Most likely that will give you a bios flasher (for DOS), and the bios file

2010-06-17 13:56:35	WormFood	jack_guru, sadly, you'll probably want to make a bootable usb memory stick with dos (or freedos), so you can flash your bios (check your motherboard manual)....some motherboards also have a bios recover jumper (intel I know of, but probably others), where you just have to put the file on a FAT formatted usb memory stick, and it will update automatically)

2010-06-17 13:58:29	jack_guru	WormFood, well it is just a single .exe so it should be an installer. The good new is that the laptop has an Intel processor, so is there any chance it will auto-install it from a flash drive? even without freeDOS?
2010-06-17 13:59:25	WormFood	perhaps. If it will do it, you'll probably have a menu item in the bios, or perhaps you can hit a key on boot up, to flash it. It all depends on your bios, and if it supports that feature or not

2010-08-27 21:52:37	Hydroxide	mabdy: similar to what cafuego just said, I think Debian will give you more of a reason to learn how things work, but if you happen to want to do the most common consumer-oriented use cases and don't happen to hit any rough edges in a particular Ubuntu release and don't want to upgrade between releases without installing, Ubuntu is a reasonable option

Unfortunately, it's just a desktop box and didn't come with the handy remote management console. Is there anything I can do so in the future I'll have remote power control and remote console?

2010-11-09 17:57:44	dpkg	Journaling filesystems in a nutshell: <peterS> fast but dangerous: reiserfs.  medium-speed but reliable: ext3.  fast, mostly reliable, and *huge*: xfs.  slow, probably reliable: jfs.  unknown, probably buggy: reiser4.  If you have to ask, use <ext3>.  Old benchmarks at http://fsbench.netnation.com/ .  http://wiki.debian.org/FileSystem  #linuxfs on irc.oftc.net.

2011-03-22 19:00:31	Bushmills	"mozplugger allows you to seamlessly integrate external applications to view files downloaded from the web that Mozilla can not normally handle"

2011-03-22 19:00:41	blast_hardcheese	Bushmills: "integrate"
2011-03-22 19:00:43	Spida	abrotman: I suspect a bug in my ripping toolchain (abcde with lame). I want to create a testcase, recording an empty wave-file (I need something that is NOT copyrighted) rip it (preferrably without burning it on a physical cd-r) and encode it
2011-03-22 19:00:56	paxcoder	Connor1, the real answer (in my opinion) is: Debian stable can have old packages, including Wine. Using unstable on the desktop (which is what I do), you must be careful not to break your system - eg. you must do safe installs which kinda suck. Also, ppl here will frown at you using unstable, suggesting (ad absurdum) you use experimental.

2011-03-22 19:01:50	Spida	abrotman: I assume that I can burn the wave to an audio disc to a cd-r, now I am thinking about taking out this step to avoid wasting a cd-r on a 1minute empty (silent) recording

2011-03-22 19:01:59	babilen	Spida: You can encode wave files directly
2011-03-22 19:02:00	paxcoder	Connor1, should i simplify? if you want new packages (and I assume you do), you can use Debian unstable, but you must be careful.
2011-03-22 19:02:06	Bushmills	blast_hardcheese: i won't grab you and push your with your nose into mozplugger, as i have already mentioned it.

2011-03-25 04:09:30	dpkg	aptitude has more advanced conflict/dependency resolution and will often find a solution where apt-get gives up. It can be used from the command line like apt-get plus an interactive resolver makes it much easier to recover from broken dependencies.  It has advanced search capabilities (see <aptitude search>). For some upgrades (lenny->squeeze) apt-get is better though. Be careful.

I'm the package maintainer, but it's been a long time, and someone sponsored the upload last time.  Is http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/update.en.html the place to start, and do I need to file a bug report about the update before proceeding?

2011-08-06 01:30:55	Abyssion	I have a friend who wants to enable Bluetooth on her Debian laptop. I know nothing whatsoever about Bluetooth, and so I need some basic help. She says that a few years back, when she was running Vista, she turned Bluetooth off, and she's never been able to turn it back on, even on Debian. This makes me think it's off at the hardware level. Anyway, how would I tell her to turn on her Bluetooth adapter?
