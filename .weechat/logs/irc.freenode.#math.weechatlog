2010-04-23 12:29:51	Aufwind	Algebraist: It means, that I can differentiate the function by every variable. And I get the Gradient.
2010-04-23 12:30:03	Algebraist	Aufwind: but there only is one variable!
2010-04-23 12:30:08	silasdavis	Algebraist: yeah I think you're right, and it is sufficient too. I'm working from A, B algebraic complements of X, i.e. A n B = {}, A u B = X, then x in X can be written a + b. Projection operator associated with some algebraic complement A is P(a + b) = a
2010-04-23 12:30:27	akafubu	fax: i don't understand
2010-04-23 12:30:39	Aufwind	Algebraist: Ay, then if it is partial differentiable in R it is automatically  differentiable in R?

2010-04-23 12:30:58	fax	akafubu: When b is less than 8, half of b is less than half of 8
2010-04-23 12:31:29	fax	akafubu: what you can do is build up the expression (1/2)b - 4 in stages, bringing the inequality along for the rideg -- that's how you derive a < 0
2010-04-23 12:32:22	fax	akafubu, I used these two general rules:  a<b -> a+k<b+k  a<b -> ka<kb  (k must be positive in the second case or the inequality flips around)
2010-04-23 12:33:01	fax	akafubu: You can prove those two theorems using the definition  a<b :<=> exists d > 0, a+d=b

2010-04-23 16:30:18	JordiGH	So you have to take the fifth root of that one.
2010-04-23 16:31:51	fax	of the polynomial?
2010-04-23 16:31:57	JordiGH	But according to van der Waerden's method, you have to do this five times, once for each 5th root. So you have to take five x^(1/5), and you have to be careful which one you do each time, because you have to pick them in such a way that sum(L(zk)^5)^(1/5), k=1..5) = 5y
2010-04-23 16:32:19	JordiGH	Yeah, fifth root of that, you need to recover the Lagrange resolvent L from L^5.
2010-04-23 16:32:40	JordiGH	Where 5y is a root of the original quintic.
2010-04-23 16:32:54	fax	is it possible to use numerical approximations to know which roots are which?
2010-04-23 16:33:11	JordiGH	I thought symmetry would kick in, kinda like it does for the cubic equation, where even though there are six ways to express the solution, it turns out that only three ultimately distinct ones, but no.
2010-04-23 16:33:40	JordiGH	Yeah, it is. But that's really unsatisfactory. The radical expressions get horrible enough as it is, especially if you replace z by its own expression in radicals.
2010-04-23 16:34:23	JordiGH	So having to pick which one of the horrible radical expressions you should use based on numerical approximation... there must be a better way.

2010-05-03 03:48:14	AnonDiss	Hello. x^2 = x can be solved easily by saying x^2 - x = 0 => x(x-1) = 0 => x = 0, 1. But if we take the original equation and divide by x, we have x = 1, which is only part of the solution. Essentially, we've lost information by destroying the quadratic nature of the equation. Is there a mathematical term for this loss of information?

2010-05-03 03:49:09	xerox	AnonDiss: you've not, you can only divide by x if x =/= 0, you also have to consider what happens when x=0 and you can't divide.

2010-05-03 03:50:16	AnonDiss	xerox: Right, so it has to do with the illegality of the division by zero. The fact that we can't divide by zero implicitly forces us to consider the case x = 0 whenever we divide. Is that right?

2010-05-03 07:48:21	anodesni	I use conjugate gradients to solve Ax=b, A has 5 diagonals with constant values (from central finite difference approximation of the laplace operator).

2010-05-03 07:49:07	anodesni	is this due to the fact that (-A) has large diagonal entries?

2010-05-08 07:52:48	timeout	|Steve|: ok, so you guys are saying that right to left is the accepted convention?
2010-05-08 07:52:53	|Steve|	Since I read left to right, I apply my permutations in that order.
2010-05-08 07:53:03	|Steve|	No. I'm saying that all conventions are fine, you just have to be explicit.
2010-05-08 07:53:07	timeout	well, I do to.

2010-05-08 07:53:59	timeout	alright, well, I'm looking at this for the first time, so I guess, I should try it the other way and see if that corresponds to the anser ;)

2010-05-08 07:58:27	|Steve|	Why are you trying to equate a permutation with a tuple?
2010-05-08 07:59:12	timeout	hmmm... so a tuple is a particular permutation isn't it?
2010-05-08 07:59:37	|Steve|	They seem to be very different beasts to me.
2010-05-08 07:59:44	timeout	|Steve|: ok
2010-05-08 08:00:24	eoc	(13) means the following allocations: 1 ↦ 3 , 2 ↦ 2, 3 ↦ 1

I know how to do it, when all values are positive, but when there are both negative and positive, I am a bit lost, for positive I do: divider= biggest - smallest, then from all values substract the smallest value and then divide it by divider. Can someone help me, how to do it for negative...

2010-05-12 17:10:13	freeone3000	Basically, if A_i-B_i*y is bigger than A_i-B_i*x, then the inner statement will be negative. Other way around, it's positive. There's no way to tell whether it's going to be negative, unless you can constrain those three.
2010-05-12 17:11:29	freeone3000	And Max(Sum{1,-2,2}, 0) is much different from Sum(Max(1,0),Max(-2,0),Max(2,0)), hence why that's an invalid simplification.

2010-05-12 17:45:12	somiaj	kinks: yea abs(x) = x if x>=0 and -x if x<0....so just split your integral into two pieces, one for x<0 and one for x>0, i.e. int_a^b f = int_a^c + int_c^b f [where a < b < c] is a basic proerty of integrals [follows from the rieman summ definition

2010-05-15 16:52:29	tolkad	If you could multiply an irrational number by an integer, and get a rational number, then you would be able to represent that irrational number as a fraction, which is by definition impossible
2010-05-15 16:52:36	brett1479	i have another proof that relies on e being transcendental
2010-05-15 16:52:47	_llll_	if 2^aqrt(2) is irrational then you are done.  otherwise it is rational and raise tot he power of sqrt(2)

For example, the equation A + B  = 4 becomes simply B + A = 4. Furthermore, it is true, but far less obvious, that this holds for every possible algebraic equation with rational coefficients satisfied by the roots A and B; to prove this requires the theory of symmetric polynomials."

For example, the equation A + B  = 4 becomes simply B + A = 4. Furthermore, it is true, but far less obvious, that this holds for every possible algebraic equation with rational coefficients satisfied by the roots A and B; to prove this requires the theory of symmetric polynomials." now

I want to calculate P(X < 3.1). I consider Z = (X - 3.04)/(0.1) = 10*(X - 3.04). Z ~ Normal(0, 1), and X = Z/10 + 3.04. So P(X < 3.1)  = P(Z/10 - 3.04 < 3.1) = P(Z/10 < 0.06) = P(Z < 0.6).

2010-11-04 19:22:28	AryehGregor	AnonDiss, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem
2010-11-04 19:23:09	AryehGregor	Basically the solution is going to be mod 3*4*5 = 60.
2010-11-04 19:23:15	AryehGregor	The condition of 1 mod 2 is redundant to 3 mod 4.
2010-11-04 19:23:43	AryehGregor	2 mod 3 and 3 mod 4 implies 11 mod 12.
2010-11-04 19:23:46	AnonDiss	Righto, thanks.
2010-11-04 19:23:48	AryehGregor	Actually, wait.
2010-11-04 19:23:51	AryehGregor	Easier way to look at this.

2010-11-04 19:25:48	AryehGregor	The answer will be mod gcd(2, 3, 4, 5) (if it exists), not mod 2*3*4*5, in general.
2010-11-04 19:26:06	AryehGregor	If they aren't relatively prime it might not always exist, of course.  Clearly no number is = 0 (mod 2) and = 3 (mod 4).

2010-11-04 20:26:50	CESSMASTER	Gear0: I mean you can get more accuracy with the trapezoid rule by breaking the interval up finer and finer, but you could also just breka the interval up and apply simpson's rule on each interval
2010-11-04 20:27:01	CESSMASTER	Gear0: there's a discussion of accuracy in both articles
2010-11-04 20:27:31	Gear0	CESSMASTER: I will probably just run the simulation a few times with both, and decide which one seems to be more accurate and stick with it.
2010-11-04 20:27:52	contrastudio	<Tlaloc> is V = {x is a memeber of C[0,T] : x(t2) >= x(t1), t2 > t1} Dimension 2?
2010-11-04 20:28:02	CESSMASTER	Gear0: if you're using a computer, there are far better methods
2010-11-04 20:28:55	CESSMASTER	Gear0: trapezoid and simpson's rule are only worthwhile because you can do them by hand
2010-11-04 20:29:01	Gear0	CESSMASTER: well it will need to do it MANY times, so I was going for something simple and fast

2010-11-07 18:29:15	somiaj	me2290: dx/dy = (dx/dt) / (dy/dt), so you just have to find the value of t which gives the point (-1,1) so you have two equations.
2010-11-07 18:29:17	me2290	I got the slope
2010-11-07 18:29:19	AryehGregor	Doesn't matter, it's just computation.

2010-11-07 19:18:54	_kmh_	but is would be easier if you already know the geometric interpretation of a complex multiplication
2010-11-07 19:19:05	AryehGregor	It's pretty easy algebraically too.

For example, 1 +x + xy is linear in x and y, but 1+ x^2 is not....  A function f(x_1,x_2...x_n) is linear in each of the x_i and f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = 1/(x_1x_2x_3...x_n) when x_i  is in {3,4} for all i.  In terms of n, what is f(5,5,5,..5)?

2010-11-17 20:36:43	rff	for T(a,b) = (a + b, 2) this meets the linearity property T(a + c, b + d) = ( (a+c) + (b+d), 2) = ( a+b, 2) + ( c+d, 2) = T(a,b) + T(c,d) but fails for T(k(a,b)) = kT(a,b) as T(k(a,b)) = ( k(a + b), 2) != 2 (a + b, 2) = kT(a,b) hence it fails to be a linear transformation from R^2 -> R^2, yeah?

2010-11-17 21:07:06	dukebag	and over time throughout a game, you can refine that original uncertainty into something more workable... that is, the statistic should become more actionable as the game progresses, akin to how a game would already formulate itself between 2 players... a clear 'picture' of how it will play it gets chiseled away from the starting positions

2010-11-17 21:17:16	holytacos	just because the limit equals zero doesnt mean the series converges
2010-11-17 21:17:23	meingtsla	I would note two things: (1) Yes, as you say, each term is either 1/(n+1)^2 or 1/(n-1)^2. Well, 1/(n+1)^2 < 1/(n-1)^2. So sum_{n=2}^infty 1/(n+(-1)^n)^2 < sum_{n=2}^infty 1/(n-1)^2

2010-11-18 19:33:40	mariano|syzygy	AryehGregor, there is a bijection from the set of subsets of even order to that of the subsets of odd order, given by taking the complement

2010-11-18 23:56:12	hochs	norm of that ideal is in Q(sqrt(-21), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is 25 (in Q)
2010-11-18 23:56:15	hochs	double check
2010-11-18 23:56:39	hochs	norm of (5, 2 - sqrt(-21)) is 25 i mean (from Q(sqrt(-21), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) to Q)
2010-11-18 23:56:59	hochs	since norm  of that from Q(sqrt(-21)) to Q is 5
2010-11-18 23:57:04	oxeimon	ok, so it must contain the square root of the principal generator times some unit
2010-11-18 23:57:09	hochs	and Q_5(sqrt(2)) = Q_5(sqrt(3))

2010-11-19 00:00:02	robba	Yixter: Your surjectivity proof is fine, but you can use a clearer definition of surjectivity.
2010-11-19 00:00:15	hochs	double checking
2010-11-19 00:00:19	Yixter	robba: is it watertight though?
2010-11-19 00:00:54	robba	I only looked at the last portion. I'm pretty sure your prof or TA would prefer you use the more down to earth definition of surjectivity.
2010-11-19 00:01:11	robba	Er, I mean.
2010-11-19 00:01:25	robba	The definition is fine. But theres a clearer way to show a function is surjective.

2010-11-19 00:12:32	raskol	the product of the matrix form of T and the matrix form of the change of bases will be a transformation like the one you describe

2010-11-19 00:44:07	lau-	If I want to show that in the ring Z[sqrt(-5)], that (6) = (2)(3), does it make sense to say (multiples of 2)*(multiples of 3) = multiples of 6 = (6)?
2010-11-19 00:44:14	sevenless	or as a related question: how do you extract "important features" of a graph
2010-11-19 00:44:20	Nereid	lau-: show both inclusions
2010-11-19 00:44:32	Nereid	it's clear that (6) is contained in (2)(3)
2010-11-19 00:44:33	oxeimon	lau-: just use the definition of ideal product
2010-11-19 00:44:43	oxeimon	what you said is essentially correct
2010-11-19 00:44:49	oxeimon	but make sure you know exactly what you mean
2010-11-19 00:45:24	lau-	I get confused when I write it out in terms of elements
2010-11-19 00:45:34	Nereid	but yes what you said is correct
2010-11-19 00:46:03	Nereid	since (in a commutative unital ring R) you have (a) = {ra | r in R}
2010-11-19 00:46:27	lau-	say (2a+2bsqrt(-5))(3c+3dsqrt(-5)) = 6ac + 6abcd*sqrt(-5) + 6bd*(-5)
2010-11-19 00:46:48	Nereid	which 6 clearly divides
2010-11-19 00:46:59	lau-	that is taking any multiple of 2 multiplied with any multiple of 3, in the ring, and I get a multiple of 6
2010-11-19 00:47:23	lau-	but I dont think it is obvious that I get all multiples of 6
2010-11-19 00:47:35	Nereid	lau-: so that shows that (2)(3) is contained in (6)
2010-11-19 00:47:38	lau-	from e.g. the 6bd(-5) term
2010-11-19 00:47:43	Nereid	lau-: that's clear, right?
