2010-05-02 02:19:04	myke	all i need to do is change what to get it to use gmake?
2010-05-02 02:19:16	tobiasu	do you have a link?
2010-05-02 02:19:56	tobiasu	automake cares about this, and if the author didn't fuck up, it generates bsd make compatible files
2010-05-02 02:20:55	myke	http://pastebin.com/AWKZq2ac
2010-05-02 02:21:02	myke	it's libsigc++

2010-05-02 03:41:48	myke	my freebsd systems have it
2010-05-02 03:41:51	myke	yea
2010-05-02 03:42:05	tobiasu	they kept doing it until they realised that they created a giant mess
2010-05-02 03:42:33	myke	seems like in the early days there was this attitude of "let's do everything different from bsd just to not be bsd"
2010-05-02 03:42:39	tobiasu	so then, they invented sysfs to create something clean and simple
2010-05-02 03:43:09	tobiasu	and now they make a mess of sysfs, i'm waiting for the sysfs-ng patchset already
2010-05-02 03:43:42	tobiasu	there is proc in openbsd
2010-05-02 03:43:56	tobiasu	it's just that sysctl offers a much better interface
