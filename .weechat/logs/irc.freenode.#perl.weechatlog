2010-05-04 21:24:03	ShibaKun	if I later access the storage array from one of the subroutines, it is as if the entries were not parsed
2010-05-04 21:24:23	ShibaKun	but I can see them parsing in real-time by placing prints in the parse_logs sub
2010-05-04 21:24:37	ShibaKun	what is happening to the data?
2010-05-04 21:24:41	ew73	ShibaKun: Two things -- first, read 'perldoc perltoot' and familiarize yourself with how 'raw' perl OO works.  And second, for new projects, you should be using Moose.
2010-05-04 21:25:46	ew73	ShibaKun: The short of it, though, is 'raw' OO means you, the coder, create your own constructor, traditionally naming it 'new', which blesses a reference with a name, like say, 'ALP'.
2010-05-04 21:25:48	Wolfman2000	Evening. I'm working on a perl script that is meant to work with both traditional linux/mac and hopefully a Strawberry Perl environment. Two of the tasks that I need to accomplish is to copy certain files from multiple directories to the current directory, and deleting the files afterwards. Is there an OS independent way of doing so?
2010-05-04 21:26:36	ew73	Method invocation on your blessed thingy then works such that the methods, $obj->some_sub( 'foo' ); is exactly the same as calling ALP::some_sub( $obj, 'foo' );
2010-05-04 21:26:40	ShibaKun	ew73: I can use OO, but I was under the impression that I didn't have to -- i.e., the symbol @entries would be visible to my module regardless
2010-05-04 21:27:10	ShibaKun	so what you're saying is that to do what I want to do, I must use OO
2010-05-04 21:27:12	ShibaKun	correct?

2010-05-10 04:35:01	maasha	a delightful tutorial
2010-05-10 04:35:21	maasha	variable: start with that one, and then ask here if you are still stuck.
2010-05-10 04:35:35	maasha	(which you are not of cause)
2010-05-10 04:35:43	variable	maasha: I always try to RTM before asking questions ;)
2010-05-10 04:36:31	 *	variable thinks perl was designed to confuse programmers ;)
2010-05-10 04:36:35	maasha	variable: sure. that tutorial is helpful. but you could try to do it the sed way. Perl have borrowed a lot from sed.

Our brave prince starts out the book looking heroic and dashing, but deep inside he is filled with self-doubts about his worth as a warrior and perhaps if he is even truly a prince, but then he has a princess to rescue and he must fight his way through evil obstacles to reach her. Eventually he fights his way to the princess but then at the last moment an evil dragon leaps out at him. He fears he is lost but he summons up the ...
2010-05-10 04:53:06	buu	... last of his great courage and defeats the dragon then rescues the princess. Rushing up to her he kisses her deeply and true love is born, then she stabs him in the back as soon as he turns away.

2010-05-12 18:02:20	LeoNerd	Random question... Does anyone know why it's the case in perl, that even though only references can be objects, the bless information is stored in the actual underlying SV, and not the RV?

2010-05-12 18:05:05	integral	It makes more sense to me to think of the data structure itself being the object, with the behaviour of an object attached to it.  If you blessed references instead, I'd expect to have fun with multiple references to the same data structure with different tags
2010-05-12 18:05:05	anno	LeoNerd: if the ref was blessed, a copy would be unblessed

If your lists are Very large, or you do this millions of times, you need to do something different.

2010-05-14 13:13:44	tome	but it sounds like your condition is complex enough that you'd want to find a good way to merge the lists, perhaps taking advantage of some properties on the lists, and a sort function is always a 2 item compare (you cannot batch items to save comparisons, etc.)

2010-05-14 13:20:19	tm604	faceface: if it consistently returns 0 for that pair, the order shouldn't change (stable sort). If the same pair sometimes returns 0, sometimes a different value, behaviour is probably undefined?

2010-05-14 13:20:54	tome	according to the docs, in recent perls, the sort function is stable, so if you return 0 for items that are equal they will stay in that order. If you  'randomly' return 0 (your word I think) then... umm.... : D

2010-05-14 15:51:49	Guest14649	on how to register variables correctly?
2010-05-14 15:52:12	SnakeChomp	Hi folks. Just wondering, is it considered bad form, stylistically or otherwise, to do non trivial things in your BEGIN{} and END{} blocks? In my case, I am reading input from stdin and writing to a temporary file in BEGIN{}, using the file in my program, and deleting the file on END{}.

2010-05-14 15:55:05	SnakeChomp	And you should always use strict in your program
2010-05-14 15:55:07	PerlJam	Guest14649: "use warnings;" and "use strict;" are tools that help you write code better.  Use them.

2010-05-14 17:40:15	DrForr	Used to be that you had to say 'local $_;' to localize $_ in a function, nowadays my() works just as well.
2010-05-14 17:40:38	DrForr	I just hadn't seen that idiom in a long time.

2010-05-15 13:03:49	mutewit	Is there a quick way to reset the perl regex variables on successive matching operations.
2010-05-15 13:04:07	mutewit	For eg., there's a match and I use $1 to extract the  value
2010-05-15 13:04:33	mutewit	Further down, I do another match with a different regex but if nothing is found $1 does not get reset.
2010-05-15 13:05:07	thrig	put the 2nd match in a if statement or somesuch before using $1

2010-05-15 18:56:41	derchiller	is it usual or "good" code to use "if ( $_[0] ) { print "not enoutgh params..." ??
2010-05-15 18:57:06	penma	in a subroutine, you want croak, not print
2010-05-15 18:57:22	derchiller	the print is not important to me
2010-05-15 18:57:59	derchiller	the question is if using an "if ( $_[0] )" is good code or should i write for "right usage" and do not code sth like above?

2010-11-09 05:26:13	Altreus	EdwardIII: Possibly both indeed. After all, not only has it been shown that there is as wide a range of sleep patterns as there are cultures, but people who don't have a 24-hour, 9-5 sleep pattern are generally more productive when they *are* productive than everyone else
2010-11-09 05:26:29	ew73	Though, it's a simple correlation, smart people sleep in later.  Not because they are smart, nor does sleeping in later make you smarter.
2010-11-09 05:26:48	Altreus	Meaning that the most productive people in society are forced to be the least productive, by the otherwise least productive

2010-11-09 08:54:16	ne2k	hmmm. odd. apparently, you can connect a REAC device to a computer and record multitracks (with special software), but apparently it's a layer1 protocol, not using standard ethernet frames. not sure how exactly that would work

2010-11-09 08:59:05	guidevita	hi guys i have a quick question. is there a way to compile perl programs?
2010-11-09 08:59:13	guidevita	i saw there is a way on windows
2010-11-09 08:59:18	LeoNerd	Define "compile"
2010-11-09 08:59:23	guidevita	translate into binary
2010-11-09 08:59:26	squeeks_	they're compiled everytime you run them.
2010-11-09 08:59:39	guidevita	yup but say i want the binary
2010-11-09 08:59:41	BinGOs	I live in a broken record world.

2010-11-09 09:00:27	BinGOs	That doesn't help really.
2010-11-09 09:00:28	mkramer	*for future
2010-11-09 09:01:02	BinGOs	But it sometimes the reason for the question.
2010-11-09 09:01:16	guidevita	i don't care about hiding the code
2010-11-09 09:01:22	LeoNerd	Perhaps explain the eventual behaviour you want, not the means by which you think you'll obtain it
2010-11-09 09:01:26	squeeks_	par, fatpacker, etc.
2010-11-09 09:01:27	guidevita	open source ftw hehe
2010-11-09 09:01:52	guidevita	i just want my program in binary, nothing else
2010-11-09 09:01:55	BinGOs	It is either because a). one wishes to hide the source; b). for deployment purposes.
2010-11-09 09:02:13	mkramer	personally I wish I could hide my source
2010-11-09 09:02:20	mkramer	I would like to sell some of the things I write
2010-11-09 09:02:21	guidevita	c) just to know if i can
2010-11-09 09:02:31	squeeks_	mkramer: source visible or not has nothing to do with selling.
2010-11-09 09:02:44	mkramer	yes, it does
2010-11-09 09:02:55	BinGOs	disassemblers tbh
2010-11-09 09:02:55	squeeks_	no. licences have everything to do with selling.
2010-11-09 09:02:59	mkramer	d) avoid compilation expense every time I run my code
2010-11-09 09:03:13	BinGOs	But anyways.
2010-11-09 09:03:45	guidevita	i agree with squeeks_
2010-11-09 09:03:47	mkramer	squeeks_: no, actually.  I want teeth in my licensing agreement

2010-11-09 17:21:38	mauke	if your question makes no sense, there can't be a correct answer
2010-11-09 17:21:43	sps12118	When using Data::Dumper to dump out a hash, is there anyway to sort the keys and stuff? I have a new method that populates a hash which replaces another one and when I compare the two Data dumps they are slightly different, i think because the order of the keys in the hash are not guaranteed
2010-11-09 17:21:46	Altreus	Why do you presume it makes no sense?
2010-11-09 17:22:03	Altreus	Do you not have the capacity to replace incorrect terminology?

2010-11-09 17:24:31	Altreus	thanks all the same but I'll use what tm604 said since it works
2010-11-09 17:25:04	preaction	so cpan is only used to read perldoc? where do i get the module from then?

2010-11-09 18:12:32	peterS	tm604: so that's intentional, that the 'my' scope moves "outward" in such a construct?
2010-11-09 18:12:34	jimster	is it true that the easiest way to pass an object into a thread is to use Thread::Queue?
2010-11-09 18:13:24	tm604	peterS: far as I know it's intentional, but it's deprecated or at least not recommended. Use state if you really want that behaviour. The scope isn't extended, it just doesn't reset the variable on re-entry.

2010-11-09 20:28:48	mhall	I might have to take this DB (which is exported periodically from another system) and convert it to a faster DB like mysql MyISAM or GDBM.
2010-11-09 20:28:55	tm604	I think it uses sqlite3_open, so it can't pass the readonly option across? If you update DBD::SQLite to use the v2 or v3 interface instead then you should be able to pass the option through, or just edit the sqlite3.c implementation to force it true for a one-off benchmark.

2010-11-09 20:29:12	mhall	initself: Well the problem is that this is coming off of a production feed which is an autogenerated sqlite3 file.

Running the selects inside a transaction should prevent close/reopen on the file, maybe try throwing a full table lock at it would help so it doesn't have to keep locking partial ranges of the file, although again I doubt that'll have much effect.

2010-11-09 20:45:50	tm604	The more data you transfer, the less performance increase you'll get because it has to copy the data between processes (much faster than plain disk access, of course).
2010-11-09 20:46:05	mhall	that's what had pointed me down the non-acid route in sqlite if doable
2010-11-09 20:46:26	mhall	but maybe i went the wrong route and multiprocess / multicore was a better idea
2010-11-09 20:46:31	tm604	yeah, mysql with --run-with-scissors is seductively swift at times if you're not too bothered with the results. mysql_use_result works well for that too.

2010-11-09 20:47:01	mhall	this is two queries

2010-11-09 20:50:26	mhall	the problem with passing 1k IPs is that this front-end process is supposed to batch a hunk of objects into 60 second time blocks

2011-01-03 10:24:33	talexb	tm604 Ah .. so '%' . $str would be more appropriate.
2011-01-03 10:25:03	tm604	talexb: might be clearer to read, but should be equivalent to "%$str", at least as far as I recall.

2011-01-03 10:25:35	talexb	tm604 I was thinking of a hashref -> hash, when in fact, the '%' had to do with a LIKE condition ..

2011-02-06 22:14:30	dbbolton	thrig: there's a certain number on a certain line in the output of `free -m` that i want to grab

2011-02-06 22:14:58	apeiron	WAIT NO
2011-02-06 22:15:01	dbbolton	it's possible with grep and awk, but yuck
2011-02-06 22:15:14	person	So for example in my repo the main script has 'use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib'. This runs fine if the script is in the right place, but once i use perl packer on it, then move the executable it doesn't work.

2011-02-06 22:20:48	person	The line in question is as I described above. If I just do a normal pack with -o and then move the executable it can no longer locate the files in ../lib naturally. Was wondering if there is a way to include the dependencies as part of the executable or something.
2011-02-06 22:21:28	person	Will try -I

2011-02-22 23:52:30	ubajas	It should be a fairly decent metric though?
2011-02-22 23:52:59	alyx	so, I'm lazy, and I have a file with lots of useless "" where '' could be used. Sometimes though, it has to be used (if I've got like, \n or something, or if I've got a $variable). I was thinking of doing a regex to do a mass change for this, but I'm stuck on how to handle "blah 'blah' blah"-type strings. Any suggestions on how to do a nice regex for this and/or a better way to do this?
2011-02-22 23:53:01	ubajas	But not if Perl had 13% "the other day".
2011-02-22 23:53:17	mst	alyx: what's the point?
2011-02-22 23:53:24	ubajas	alyx, ignore it, and do better in the next script.

2011-02-22 23:56:24	obsd123	if you wanted to do it anyway, though, you could keep track of whether you were in a string and what the delimiter was.  If yes, then ignore any string char ('|") that is not the same as the opening delimiter until that string is closed.

2011-02-23 11:18:37	Altreus	cos IRC doesn't have nearly so many control characters as RTF.
2011-02-23 11:18:39	burnedcelery	But you get a lot of formatting for free
2011-02-23 11:19:02	Altreus	you won't be able to specify exact colours or italics or things like that

2011-02-23 11:19:22	Altreus	So your input box might be nice and pretty but it'll all be pared down to bold, underline and 16 colours
2011-02-23 11:19:43	burnedcelery	Well, you could use custom colors for event formatting, too
2011-02-23 11:19:56	Altreus	can you send any old colour by IRC?
2011-02-23 11:20:03	Altreus	or is it 0..15?
2011-02-23 11:20:05	LeoNerd	I don't see why not
2011-02-23 11:20:14	LeoNerd	mIRC and irssi schemes are custom made-up ones. :)
2011-02-23 11:20:15	Altreus	I don't know how it's sent :)
2011-02-23 11:20:18	LeoNerd	Can easily make up another custom one
2011-02-23 11:20:30	Altreus	well irssi is influenced by what my terminal says
2011-02-23 11:20:36	LeoNerd	mIRC uses ^C prefixes. irssi uses an ANSI/X.35/ECMA-48 style
2011-02-23 11:20:42	burnedcelery	it's \c02 and some numbers, dunno what supports extended colors
2011-02-23 11:20:58	LeoNerd	No reason you couldn't do  CSI 38;3;rrr;ggg;bbb m Here is arbitrary RGB8
2011-02-23 11:21:01	Altreus	I suspect that's because irssi is targetting the lowest-common-denominator console
2011-02-23 11:21:14	Altreus	It depends what *IRC* allows
2011-02-23 11:21:16	LeoNerd	.oO( Is 3 RGB8? I forget... )
2011-02-23 11:21:19	LeoNerd	IRC doesn't care
2011-02-23 11:21:25	burnedcelery	The IRCd just passes it on
2011-02-23 11:21:30	LeoNerd	PRIVMSG is just an opaque payload not containing CR LF or BEL
2011-02-23 11:21:37	LeoNerd	(yes, BEL is excluded. No I don't know why)
2011-02-23 11:21:39	Altreus	Surely the protocol specifies what the clients can expect to receive?
2011-02-23 11:21:46	LeoNerd	Nope
2011-02-23 11:21:47	burnedcelery	technically, the server doesn't even have to know what ctcp is, i think
2011-02-23 11:21:50	LeoNerd	2812 has no say on the matter
2011-02-23 11:22:01	LeoNerd	Even CTCP itself isn't specified anywhere

2011-02-23 11:29:44	LeoNerd	But XMPP does do one thing right - the layering
2011-02-23 11:29:53	LeoNerd	IRC tries to put semantics into mechanism. That's always bad.

2011-02-23 11:30:14	LeoNerd	XMPP says "here's a message transport. I don't care what the contents of those messages are. But here's a mechanism for you to negotiate what those messages mean"
2011-02-23 11:30:25	Altreus	that seems to clarify
2011-02-23 11:30:29	LeoNerd	So then you can send messages between endpoints, using XMPP as the message bus, and agree on the meaning of those messages.

2011-02-28 19:48:13	mhall	so the thing i want to do now is make a good way to pass off the tokenized events to some processing functions
2011-02-28 19:48:37	mhall	easiest way to do it, is to make standardized set of subroutine names to call, based on the event type ID number in the event
2011-02-28 19:48:58	mhall	so that's how i got to wanting to construct the function name in a scalar, then try calling it in an eval, etc.

2011-02-28 19:50:26	mhall	thorat: whereas if i just put the name of what it should be in a scalar, then as soon as the new sub is added to the file, it gets called if it exists

2011-02-28 19:50:41	thorat	ok, sounds like methods
2011-02-28 19:50:46	thorat	right
2011-02-28 19:50:54	mhall	i can cache inside the event hash for each id, whether the func exists the first time i try calling

2011-03-01 03:04:30	bocaneri	Part of core distribution. I believe CentOS would frown on using "foreign" repos like cpan.

2011-03-01 03:04:45	roadt	rindolf,  i have no requirement for format.

2011-03-01 03:07:52	rindolf	roadt: that's the INI-file-handling module I maintain - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-IniFiles/
