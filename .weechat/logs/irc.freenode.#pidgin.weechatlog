2010-06-13 02:27:04	darkrain	This is a *pidgin* room, not a *pidgin-mpris* room.  The Pidgin developers did not write the plugin, and consequently do not support it.

2010-06-13 02:28:53	Cobalt	Or was that MXit I'm thinking about?

2010-06-13 02:58:42	darkrain	What eval returns is the return value of print, which is '1'

2010-06-13 03:17:36	Dresk	Trying to build Pidgin since my distro just stopped updating the packages for it, configure is saying it can't find xscreensaver, I'm guessing that's because everything I have is 64bit, and the config.sub file is quite confusing for simply telling Pidgin to compile as 64bit

2010-06-13 03:43:58	Arsecroft	Hey, just started trying to script pidgin via python. What is the UI parameter for the function PurpleAccountSetEnabled if i am using pidgin? I have looked around and googled with no results.
2010-06-13 03:47:01	Arsecroft	Have also tried just putting anything in that parameter, and the checkbox is checked, but the account is not online and I can't uncheck the box.
2010-06-13 03:49:04	Arsecroft	http://pastebin.ca/1882102 very simple, straight forward code. Any ideas?

2010-06-13 03:54:33	khc	#purple.PurpleAccountSetEnabled(test, "pidgin", True) I think
2010-06-13 03:55:04	dbbolton	darkrain: i see that it works for expressions like '5*7', but i want it to behave like 'perl -e "code"'. i also tried this, for general system commands, http://paste.debian.net/77212/
2010-06-13 03:55:57	dbbolton	this just prints the input string
2010-06-13 03:56:50	Arsecroft	khc: the first thing I tried, but it still has the same behavior. Maybe I have to do more to get ti to actually connect?
2010-06-13 03:57:05	khc	what do you actually want to do? reconnect?
2010-06-13 03:58:15	darkrain	I think it's actually "gtk-gaim", not "pidgin"
2010-06-13 03:58:34	Arsecroft	It's creating an account, then connecting to it.
2010-06-13 03:59:17	Arsecroft	darkrain: yes!
2010-06-13 03:59:29	darkrain	?
2010-06-13 03:59:59	Arsecroft	"gtk-gaim" worked for the ui paramater for PurpleAccountSetEnabled
2010-06-13 04:00:38	darkrain	dbbolton: You'll need to find a way to redirect standard output for Perl built-in functions (preferably without dup2()ing to stdout)
2010-06-13 04:01:12	Arsecroft	darkrain: Any idea where I could find this in the docs? Or did you just happen to know that?

2010-06-13 04:04:35	darkrain	dbbolton: For better or worse, you could always pass off the output to a spawned perl process (although I strongly suggest you do so via a pipe instead of trying to get the 15 levels of command-line argument escaping correct -- although if you're executing someone else's perl code, I guess you'd have already lost)

2010-06-13 04:16:13	darkrain	My comments about output redirection are in response to your desire to use perl's "print" function, which fundamentally just doesn't work the way you want with the eval command.
2010-06-13 04:16:27	darkrain	Pastebin your current code, please
2010-06-13 04:17:58	darkrain	sadrul's plugin doesn't have to do any wonky output redirection because it's not trying to eval() things.

2010-06-13 04:18:38	dbbolton	i tried doing unwonky things too, like catenating a few extra chars to the input string.
2010-06-13 04:19:27	darkrain	Let me rephrase: pastebin the code where you're appending some letters to $msg in the cb sub and then passing it to "say" and not seeing the extra letters.
2010-06-13 04:19:36	dbbolton	ok
2010-06-13 04:22:24	dbbolton	actually, i think the problem was that i had to restart pidgin after editing the script
2010-06-13 04:23:29	darkrain	:)
2010-06-13 04:23:59	dbbolton	here's what i did: my $msg = $args[0] . "\n" . `$args[0]`;
2010-06-13 04:24:04	dbbolton	it seems to be working
