2011-02-13 14:33:08	fsmithred	nope
2011-02-13 14:33:18	fsmithred	hi dbbolton
2011-02-13 14:34:03	nadir_	ups. hi, dbbolton
2011-02-13 14:34:07	fsmithred	you got 507 and then 512
2011-02-13 14:34:12	nadir_	ok.
2011-02-13 14:34:31	nadir_	I tried hard to keep track of it, but dean is a master not easy to follow.
2011-02-13 14:34:32	fsmithred	lol @bloated.iso
2011-02-13 14:34:38	nadir_	yup.
2011-02-13 14:35:07	nadir_	I proposed to pick release-names, but he objected.
2011-02-13 14:35:30	nadir_	ok, anyway, tnx for it.
2011-02-13 14:35:45	nadir_	not sure when i will put it to adrive. but these days.
2011-02-13 14:35:59	fsmithred	yw
2011-02-13 14:36:01	nadir_	fsmithred: one other question
2011-02-13 14:36:10	dbbolton	hey
2011-02-13 14:36:10	fsmithred	?
2011-02-13 14:36:13	nadir_	the forum, you think it works or you think: oh my.
2011-02-13 14:36:16	nadir_	hi dbbolton
2011-02-13 14:36:19	nadir_	:-)
2011-02-13 14:36:21	fsmithred	which one?
2011-02-13 14:36:39	nadir_	the new one. chaotic users in the wild
2011-02-13 14:36:50	fsmithred	yeah, I think it has potential
2011-02-13 14:36:56	nadir_	why i ask:
2011-02-13 14:37:12	nadir_	i never see you "engage" in "do it this way, do it that way"
2011-02-13 14:37:25	nadir_	and i think someone like you has got a bit more of reason to offer.
2011-02-13 14:37:36	fsmithred	I avoid politics
2011-02-13 14:37:46	nadir_	your choice, only saying that a plain word might be of help.
2011-02-13 14:37:50	fsmithred	but I probably should express some opinions
2011-02-13 14:38:10	fsmithred	hard for me to think about stuff like that
2011-02-13 14:38:15	nadir_	bit much too much of restless youth having their say.
2011-02-13 14:38:20	nadir_	np.
2011-02-13 14:38:25	nadir_	i only realized.
2011-02-13 14:38:28	fsmithred	yeah, you could be right
2011-02-13 14:38:44	nadir_	and i know that you don't shot at first thought. But rather think.
2011-02-13 14:39:51	nadir_	which is seldom to be found.
2011-02-13 14:40:02	nadir_	especially in "polital" discussions.
2011-02-13 14:40:09	nadir_	political
2011-02-13 14:42:07	nadir_	i got problems with my internet connection too (since two days)
2011-02-13 14:42:07	nadir_	in case this fails, we will need to try it again.
2011-02-13 14:42:07	nadir_	will let it run, and then we see.
2011-02-13 14:42:10	fsmithred	oh, duh. when I calculated how long it would take you, I used my up speed in the calculation
2011-02-13 14:42:14	fsmithred	I mean
2011-02-13 14:42:18	fsmithred	my down speed
2011-02-13 14:42:22	fsmithred	instead of my up
2011-02-13 14:42:33	fsmithred	you're getting 10KB/sec
2011-02-13 14:42:50	fsmithred	you'll have it before Easter
2011-02-13 14:43:16	fsmithred	5hrs is probably right
2011-02-13 14:43:31	nadir_	dosna matter.
2011-02-13 14:43:38	nadir_	I did more than one of such downloads.
2011-02-13 14:43:44	nadir_	as long it is ok for you.
2011-02-13 14:43:47	fsmithred	yeah, me too
2011-02-13 14:44:03	fsmithred	if it slows me down, I'll throttle it in the router
2011-02-13 14:44:15	fsmithred	seems ok, though
2011-02-13 14:44:28	fsmithred	probably because it's on a different box than the one I'm using
2011-02-13 14:44:45	nadir_	ok.
2011-02-13 14:44:45	nadir_	So, i am hungry as a bear. I am confused and tired.
2011-02-13 14:44:45	nadir_	Shall we call it a day?
2011-02-13 14:44:50	fsmithred	go eat
2011-02-13 14:45:01	fsmithred	and sleep
2011-02-13 14:45:12	fsmithred	talk with you later
2011-02-13 14:45:19	nadir_	i will let it run. throttle it, or not. Easter is fine for me.
2011-02-13 14:45:26	fsmithred	ok, take care
2011-02-13 14:46:45	nadir_	bye, later.

2011-02-23 11:04:43	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-23 11:04:50	@telemachus	there's also a good vim plugin for that that I use

2011-02-23 13:49:51	@antinoos	<telemachus/#study-group/2011-02-23> Check out vim-gist https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim
2011-02-23 14:30:30	@telemachus	dbbolton: No problem
2011-02-23 14:38:31	dbbolton	but i was working on a weechat script, which is why i went with a perl module
2011-02-23 14:38:41	dbbolton	the vim plugin still seems very useful though
2011-02-23 14:45:45	@telemachus	dbbolton: Ah, that makes sense. Is the module by cs9?
2011-02-23 14:46:00	@telemachus	He's done some great Perl/meets/Git stuff, as I recall
2011-02-23 14:46:28	dbbolton	http://search.cpan.org/~alexbio/WWW-GitHub-Gist-0.06/lib/WWW/GitHub/Gist.pm
2011-02-23 14:47:22	@telemachus	Very nice
2011-02-23 14:47:47	@telemachus	Do me a favor: please send me a long a copy of your plugin when it's done. I can try turning it into an irssi plugin.
2011-02-23 14:47:50	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-23 14:48:01	dbbolton	sure thing
2011-02-23 14:48:22	dbbolton	although with weechat's objects it might be easier to start from scratch
2011-02-23 15:07:51	 *	telemachus nods
2011-02-23 15:08:16	@telemachus	Still, I'll steal some of your logic, maybe. I'm completely unfamiliar with scripting for an irc client, so any help is good.
2011-02-23 15:09:48	@telemachus	Anyhow, I'm heading home, but I'll see you later

2011-02-23 15:19:02	nadir	what?
2011-02-23 15:19:09	dbbolton	as a hobby
2011-02-23 15:19:10	nadir	for fun, but it does not work good.
2011-02-23 15:19:15	nadir	yes, as a hobby.
2011-02-23 15:19:22	nadir	my plan is: five years.
2011-02-23 15:19:25	dbbolton	thats mostly my reason as well
2011-02-23 15:19:30	nadir	I hope to be able to bash and perl then.
2011-02-23 15:19:41	dbbolton	you mean professionally?
2011-02-23 15:19:51	nadir	i meant: i am able to.
2011-02-23 15:19:55	dbbolton	or just proficiently 
2011-02-23 15:19:58	nadir	professionally would be fun, sure.
2011-02-23 15:20:04	nadir	the latter.
2011-02-23 15:20:15	nadir	I for one like to be able to do things. Without reason.
2011-02-23 15:20:22	nadir	A bit strange, but the way it is.
2011-02-23 15:20:33	dbbolton	i've looked into some perl-related jobs, but they all require 2+ years experience
2011-02-23 15:20:47	dbbolton	to get a job, you need experience, to get experience, you need a job.
2011-02-23 15:20:51	dbbolton	catch-22
2011-02-23 15:20:55	nadir	If you just say: i got it. Does not work?
2011-02-23 15:21:02	nadir	people over here do it that way.
2011-02-23 15:21:13	nadir	all people, not only IT-folks
2011-02-23 15:21:19	dbbolton	they'd probably check your references
2011-02-23 15:21:22	nadir	"i am able to do anything"
2011-02-23 15:21:27	nadir	ah, references...
2011-02-23 15:21:30	dbbolton	maybe i'll try that
2011-02-23 15:21:48	nadir	It is a shame what is done with good people.
2011-02-23 15:21:52	nadir	Able to do stuff
2011-02-23 15:21:59	nadir	And they are just getting wasted.
2011-02-23 15:22:09	nadir	not sure if the point is clear... language problem.
2011-02-23 15:22:14	dbbolton	i got it
2011-02-23 15:22:43	dbbolton	speaking of language, i need to start reading something in german before i forget it
2011-02-23 15:22:56	nadir	Got an idea what?
2011-02-23 15:22:56	dbbolton	completely
2011-02-23 15:23:17	dbbolton	i have a book of short stories, german and english side-by-side
2011-02-23 15:23:37	nadir	That is what i prefer. More easy than using a dict.
2011-02-23 15:23:57	nadir	What i like too: DVDs. English, with subtitles (either English or German)
2011-02-23 15:24:07	nadir	Or listening books.
2011-02-23 15:24:22	nadir	You could try the German debian-forum.
2011-02-23 15:24:28	dbbolton	it's got heinrich von kleist, ETA hoffman, arthur schnitzler, tomas mann, and kafka
2011-02-23 15:24:39	nadir	ok; my say is: kafka.
2011-02-23 15:24:47	dbbolton	i think that would be a lot of new vocab too
2011-02-23 15:24:53	nadir	Yes.
2011-02-23 15:24:59	dbbolton	Das Urteil
2011-02-23 15:25:05	nadir	literature is very hard.
2011-02-23 15:25:06	nadir	I love kafka
2011-02-23 15:25:16	nadir	Thomas Bernhard?
2011-02-23 15:26:01	dbbolton	havent heard of him
2011-02-23 15:26:19	nadir	It is very good, check wikipedia, but very depressive.
2011-02-23 15:26:27	nadir	kafka is a bit old-school.
2011-02-23 15:26:39	nadir	But more phantasy.
2011-02-23 15:26:58	dbbolton	i've only read the metamorphosis in english 
2011-02-23 15:27:10	nadir	Yes, that is the standard over here.
2011-02-23 15:27:19	nadir	I like the "romans" ...
2011-02-23 15:27:24	nadir	!tr de en Roman
2011-02-23 15:27:25	@antinoos	Roman
2011-02-23 15:27:28	nadir	strange.
2011-02-23 15:27:29	dbbolton	novels
2011-02-23 15:27:31	nadir	Schloss
2011-02-23 15:27:34	nadir	Amerika
2011-02-23 15:27:39	nadir	das Urteil
2011-02-23 15:27:47	nadir	did you say that... ah: yes.
2011-02-23 15:28:09	nadir	Nietzsche is really good, from a language point of view ...
2011-02-23 15:28:13	dbbolton	who wrote the translate bot?
2011-02-23 15:28:18	nadir	but also old-school, and very difficult.
2011-02-23 15:28:27	nadir	the master himself: Telemachus
2011-02-23 15:28:31	nadir	but i think he forked it.
2011-02-23 15:28:40	nadir	still a heck lot of work.
2011-02-23 15:28:47	dbbolton	yeah, i imiagine
2011-02-23 15:28:53	dbbolton	imagine
2011-02-23 15:29:06	nadir	I was here, and he was moaning and complaining and trying all day...
2011-02-23 15:29:09	nadir	good show.
2011-02-23 15:29:25	dbbolton	he's a persistent one
2011-02-23 15:29:45	dbbolton	i can never focus on one project long enough to finish it
2011-02-23 15:29:54	dbbolton	i have about 6 going on right now
2011-02-23 15:29:55	nadir	hahaha: exactly my problem
2011-02-23 15:30:56	dbbolton	so why 'nadir'? you like astronomy?
2011-02-23 15:31:09	nadir	Not really.
2011-02-23 15:31:14	nadir	Two reasons:
2011-02-23 15:31:21	nadir	a) i like short names.
2011-02-23 15:31:29	nadir	b) i like to express that i am a beginner.
2011-02-23 15:31:38	nadir	nadir <-> not the zenith of linux
2011-02-23 15:31:41	nadir	so to speak.
2011-02-23 15:31:56	dbbolton	cool
2011-02-23 15:32:07	nadir	jalu -> just another linux _user_
2011-02-23 15:32:23	dbbolton	lol
2011-02-23 15:32:37	nadir	I can show you some of my stuff... in German
2011-02-23 15:32:41	nadir	but it is really strange.
2011-02-23 15:32:50	nadir	not the best german neither.
2011-02-23 15:32:56	nadir	But if you like, have a look.
2011-02-23 15:33:30	dbbolton	what kind of stuff
2011-02-23 15:33:48	nadir	one long story ( a novel)
2011-02-23 15:33:55	nadir	two short-stories
2011-02-23 15:34:02	nadir	a very few (not so good) poems
2011-02-23 15:34:08	nadir	and one about metaphysics.
2011-02-23 15:34:14	nadir	But with a heck lot of humor.
2011-02-23 15:34:31	nadir	Here it is:
2011-02-23 15:34:35	nadir	http://www.alice-dsl.net/markusklaustornow/content/writings.html
2011-02-23 15:34:54	nadir	try it, or not. If you don't like it: np. Just stop.
2011-02-23 15:35:28	nadir	Narben, the last chapter is good.
2011-02-23 15:35:51	dbbolton	would you mind if i tried to make my own english translation of a poem and see what you think
2011-02-23 15:35:57	nadir	sure.
2011-02-23 15:36:16	nadir	GPL, do with it what you consider to fit.
2011-02-23 15:36:27	nadir	If i shall look: no problem, a pleasure.
2011-02-23 15:42:39	dbbolton	whats euridykischen
2011-02-23 15:44:02	nadir	The woman of...
2011-02-23 15:44:11	nadir	mhhhh... the dude in the Hades.
2011-02-23 15:44:20	nadir	the word does not exist.
2011-02-23 15:44:31	nadir	Her name is Euridyke. Or perhaps similar.
2011-02-23 15:45:01	nadir	(it simply means: a nice singing, which may make the dead alive again)
2011-02-23 15:47:01	dbbolton	Eurydice
2011-02-23 15:47:48	nadir	thanks
2011-02-23 15:51:38	dbbolton	http://paste.debian.net/108663/
2011-02-23 15:51:49	nadir	give me  a few secs.
2011-02-23 15:52:05	nadir	it is not that i read English like my shopping-list. :-)
2011-02-23 15:56:13	nadir	dbbolton,
2011-02-23 15:56:14	nadir	?
2011-02-23 15:56:39	dbbolton	yeah
2011-02-23 15:56:54	nadir	ah.
2011-02-23 15:57:01	nadir	I think the sense is not correct.
2011-02-23 15:57:04	nadir	the meaning.
2011-02-23 15:57:19	nadir	But i got hard times, so i might be wrong.
2011-02-23 15:57:35	dbbolton	which part
2011-02-23 15:57:37	nadir	Shall i try to tell you what i want to say with each sentece, and you double-check?
2011-02-23 15:57:44	nadir	wait.
2011-02-23 15:57:49	dbbolton	ok
2011-02-23 15:58:34	nadir	I think the first sentence is tranlated in the correct meaning, but don't know all words you use.
2011-02-23 15:58:36	nadir	I mean:
2011-02-23 15:58:51	nadir	The last humans are just as brutal as the death.
2011-02-23 15:58:58	nadir	Which means: humans suck.
2011-02-23 15:59:06	nadir	I think you said that?
2011-02-23 15:59:07	dbbolton	oh, i screwed up
2011-02-23 15:59:10	nadir	fuck.
2011-02-23 15:59:27	nadir	Shall we go on?
2011-02-23 16:00:35	dbbolton	"only the last remnantS of mankind ARE relentlessly next to death"
2011-02-23 16:00:47	dbbolton	"next to" can mean a comparison
2011-02-23 16:00:54	nadir	I guess yes, but it is heavy sutff.
2011-02-23 16:01:01	nadir	i see.
2011-02-23 16:01:05	nadir	sounds better.
2011-02-23 16:02:23	nadir	Move on?
2011-02-23 16:03:21	dbbolton	sure
2011-02-23 16:03:33	nadir	ok.
2011-02-23 16:03:43	nadir	With the next sentece i try to say:
2011-02-23 16:04:06	nadir	I complain, and the humans (we just spoke of) are nothing but disgusted by that.
2011-02-23 16:04:19	nadir	I don't think you translated like that. Did you?
2011-02-23 16:05:05	dbbolton	grievances are the same as complaints
2011-02-23 16:05:12	nadir	Sure,
2011-02-23 16:05:22	nadir	but you did say.... become true.
2011-02-23 16:05:24	nadir	erfüllen
2011-02-23 16:05:38	dbbolton	what's erfuellen sich mean then?
2011-02-23 16:05:39	nadir	does not mean become true (in this sentence).
2011-02-23 16:05:42	nadir	It means: fill.
2011-02-23 16:05:55	nadir	They are filled with "disgust"
2011-02-23 16:05:55	dbbolton	like filling up a cup with water
2011-02-23 16:06:03	dbbolton	that kind of fill?
2011-02-23 16:06:06	nadir	like that.
2011-02-23 16:06:08	nadir	exactly.
2011-02-23 16:06:12	dbbolton	ok, i get it
2011-02-23 16:06:15	nadir	It means what you said, but not here.
2011-02-23 16:06:43	nadir	ok? move on?
2011-02-23 16:06:48	dbbolton	ok
2011-02-23 16:07:01	nadir	line 6 seems to fit, but a "no" is missing:
2011-02-23 16:07:16	nadir	and they crowd around the tree of my dreams unlike animals:
2011-02-23 16:07:19	nadir	should read:
2011-02-23 16:07:36	nadir	and they don't crowd around the tree of my dreams like the animals
2011-02-23 16:07:48	nadir	I got dreams.
2011-02-23 16:08:01	nadir	They, the humans, don't understand them.
2011-02-23 16:08:05	dbbolton	they seem the same to me
2011-02-23 16:08:10	nadir	yes?
2011-02-23 16:08:15	nadir	ok, good then.
2011-02-23 16:08:20	dbbolton	cause i said "unlike" instead of "not like"
2011-02-23 16:08:40	nadir	It is unusual for me, if you say it says the same it should be right.
2011-02-23 16:09:02	nadir	ok, so far, yes?
2011-02-23 16:09:03	dbbolton	the second way might be clearer
2011-02-23 16:09:06	dbbolton	yeah
2011-02-23 16:09:42	nadir	Ah, it is not they who evesdrop to the eurid*** voice.
2011-02-23 16:09:50	nadir	But that is exactly my dream.
2011-02-23 16:10:01	dbbolton	what is the subject of that part
2011-02-23 16:10:02	nadir	The one they don't want to follow:
2011-02-23 16:10:22	nadir	being quite, and listening to that voice, of Eurydice
2011-02-23 16:10:22	nadir	it is me
2011-02-23 16:10:53	nadir	Let me check the german version.
2011-02-23 16:11:04	nadir	In the german version the last word of the sentence before that is:
2011-02-23 16:12:16	nadir	meine Hoffnung
2011-02-23 16:12:16	nadir	which means: my hope
2011-02-23 16:12:16	nadir	Next sentence starts with:
2011-02-23 16:12:16	nadir	Still der Stimme horchen
2011-02-23 16:12:28	nadir	which means:
2011-02-23 16:12:28	nadir	Listening to that voice in silence.
2011-02-23 16:12:32	dbbolton	oh, i get it
2011-02-23 16:12:42	nadir	my hope:
2011-02-23 16:12:48	nadir	Still der Stimme horchen
2011-02-23 16:12:49	nadir	fuck.
2011-02-23 16:12:50	nadir	Meine Hoffnung:
2011-02-23 16:12:50	nadir	Still der STimme horchen
2011-02-23 16:12:50	nadir	->
2011-02-23 16:12:50	nadir	My hope:
2011-02-23 16:12:51	nadir	Listening to that voice in silence.
2011-02-23 16:12:51	nadir	(translate the English to proper English, i only try to give the idea)
2011-02-23 16:12:57	nadir	Good, or more questions about the meaning of the text?
2011-02-23 16:13:22	dbbolton	i think i got it
2011-02-23 16:13:39	dbbolton	it was kind of strange but really piqued my interest
2011-02-23 16:13:52	nadir	yes, it is strange.
2011-02-23 16:14:54	nadir	Also: imho: one will barely be able to tranlsate it.
2011-02-23 16:14:55	nadir	if one does not speak both languages perfect.
2011-02-23 16:14:55	nadir	Like with any texts....
2011-02-23 16:14:55	nadir	I read a lot of Beckett.
2011-02-23 16:15:06	nadir	And i became very "resignative"
2011-02-23 16:15:07	nadir	Which is a bit hard to get too.
2011-02-23 16:15:11	dbbolton	i have to go now, i have company
2011-02-23 16:15:24	dbbolton	until next time

2011-02-26 09:12:58	@telemachus	dbbolton: The one time that happened to me, it meant that the machine I was working from didn't have its git config squared away.
2011-02-26 09:13:08	@telemachus	check the output of git config --list
2011-02-26 09:15:29	@telemachus	!memo dbbolton Your git configuration is probably missing your email. I think that's where Github picks up the gravatar from.

2011-02-26 10:42:04	nadir	i am so-so.
2011-02-26 10:42:15	nadir	thanks for asking
2011-02-26 10:42:24	nadir	You are fine?
2011-02-26 10:43:58	@telemachus	I saw that yeah, thanks
2011-02-26 10:44:04	@telemachus	And I am ok
2011-02-26 10:44:12	@telemachus	we have new washing machines in my apt building
2011-02-26 10:44:20	@telemachus	wreaking havoc on my habits
2011-02-26 10:44:25	 *	telemachus is a creature of habit
2011-02-26 10:45:02	nadir	wait. new washing machines? huh?
2011-02-26 10:45:10	@telemachus	It's amazing to me that mzlikaki and craigevil come back to the forums after months and say, "Wow. Messy. Be nice. Stop."
2011-02-26 10:45:18	@telemachus	As if, poof, all better.
2011-02-26 10:45:19	@telemachus	Ugh
2011-02-26 10:45:35	@telemachus	In my apartment building, as in many in NYC, we share a single laundry room.
2011-02-26 10:45:43	nadir	shall i give you a word about mzilikazi, or better not?
2011-02-26 10:45:50	nadir	ah, ok, that is seldom here.
2011-02-26 10:45:53	@telemachus	In the room, there are say five washing machines and then four dryers.
2011-02-26 10:46:00	@telemachus	We all share them.
2011-02-26 10:46:08	@telemachus	They just replaced all the washers
2011-02-26 10:46:10	@telemachus	with new ones
2011-02-26 10:46:12	nadir	like in the third world then?
2011-02-26 10:46:13	@telemachus	which is good and bad
2011-02-26 10:46:14	nadir	ha ha ha.
2011-02-26 10:46:22	@telemachus	third world, they share a river
2011-02-26 10:46:23	@telemachus	I think
2011-02-26 10:46:24	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-26 10:46:29	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-02-26 10:46:32	@telemachus	But sure
2011-02-26 10:46:35	@telemachus	third world, NYC
2011-02-26 10:46:35	nadir	So you are a step ahead.
2011-02-26 10:46:48	@telemachus	loads cost 2.00
2011-02-26 10:46:54	@telemachus	river just costs a walk
2011-02-26 10:46:57	@telemachus	so maybe I'm behind
2011-02-26 10:46:58	@telemachus	not sure
2011-02-26 10:47:02	@telemachus	grumble
2011-02-26 10:47:07	@telemachus	anyhow, it's all fine
2011-02-26 10:47:10	nadir	I think i would prefer NewYork.
2011-02-26 10:47:12	@telemachus	but I have my habits, as I say
2011-02-26 10:47:16	@telemachus	me too
2011-02-26 10:47:29	@telemachus	I don't mean to be too glib about the third world
2011-02-26 10:47:32	@telemachus	not very nice of me
2011-02-26 10:48:05	nadir	WEll: my joke was more about the third world inside of the so called empire.
2011-02-26 10:48:15	nadir	( g7 or g8 or whatever)
2011-02-26 10:48:19	nadir	huge areas...
2011-02-26 10:48:45	@telemachus	ah, I see
2011-02-26 10:48:57	nadir	let me tell you:
2011-02-26 10:49:02	@telemachus	I immediately thought Africa, parts of India, etc.
2011-02-26 10:49:05	nadir	I got no bed. no refrigerator.
2011-02-26 10:49:10	@telemachus	silly American
2011-02-26 10:49:14	nadir	mhh... what else is missing?

2011-02-26 10:49:47	nadir	ha ha ha.
2011-02-26 10:49:51	@telemachus	hmm
2011-02-26 10:49:53	@telemachus	ok
2011-02-26 10:49:53	nadir	Welcome to the first world.
2011-02-26 10:49:57	@telemachus	yeah
2011-02-26 10:50:05	nadir	If you would make a film how i live,
2011-02-26 10:50:12	nadir	no people would come to here anymore.
2011-02-26 10:50:24	nadir	i and many others, btw.
2011-02-26 10:50:32	@telemachus	Yes, I understand
2011-02-26 10:50:53	nadir	I missed a vacuum cleaner for a year. Not so funny.
2011-02-26 10:51:20	nadir	I for one can deal with it (the washing machine is scaring me a bit)
2011-02-26 10:51:31	nadir	but i know lots of others got hard times.
2011-02-26 10:51:58	@telemachus	I would imagine
2011-02-26 10:52:06	@telemachus	what is unemployment rate now in Germany?
2011-02-26 10:52:19	nadir	I think (!!!) 10 %
2011-02-26 10:52:29	nadir	But:
2011-02-26 10:52:42	nadir	they make people do "work" for 1 per hour.
2011-02-26 10:52:54	nadir	Then they are not unemployed anymore.
2011-02-26 10:52:58	nadir	qua statistic.
2011-02-26 10:53:49	nadir	but... to put another light on that subject...
2011-02-26 10:53:58	nadir	i will probably buy a laptop next week.
2011-02-26 10:54:08	 *	telemachus nods
2011-02-26 10:54:12	@telemachus	congrats
2011-02-26 10:54:14	@telemachus	what kind?

2011-02-26 10:55:29	@telemachus	actually, let me say, in a minute, I go to deal with laundry
2011-02-26 10:55:32	@telemachus	speaking of that
2011-02-26 10:55:37	@telemachus	dryer, folding, etc.
2011-02-26 10:55:44	@telemachus	then out for the day's errands
2011-02-26 10:55:54	@telemachus	but I should be around in the afternoon
2011-02-26 10:56:07	@telemachus	before I go: are you doing your homework?
2011-02-26 10:56:08	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-26 10:56:33	nadir	i did read about regex chapter 6
2011-02-26 10:56:37	nadir	not to hard.
2011-02-26 10:56:46	nadir	then went back to input-output. oh my.
2011-02-26 10:57:18	nadir	but yes, i liked the regex chapter.
2011-02-26 10:57:41	nadir	fsmithred and i will meet later ( i hope)

2011-02-26 13:02:38	fsmithred	I'm just adding some comments to display_savior v.02
2011-02-26 13:03:20	fsmithred	did you get a chance to play with the graphical installer?
2011-02-26 13:03:25	nadir	i had a short look, but it was above me.
2011-02-26 13:03:36	nadir	i tried version5 of ...mhhh... installer.
2011-02-26 13:03:41	nadir	zenity-stuff.
2011-02-26 13:03:43	nadir	It worked.
2011-02-26 13:03:53	fsmithred	it's pretty simple - it just asks you for some values and echoes them into a clean xorg.conf
2011-02-26 13:03:56	fsmithred	cool
2011-02-26 13:03:58	nadir	damn, that is what you asked, sorry.
2011-02-26 13:04:09	nadir	Yes, it did work. But i did not test the xorg.conf stuff.
2011-02-26 13:04:15	fsmithred	we're talking about two things at once
2011-02-26 13:04:23	nadir	whew...
2011-02-26 13:04:26	fsmithred	yes, I wanted you to test zinstaller
2011-02-26 13:05:04	fsmithred	I want to make sure all the questions and decisions work before I let it loose on a hard drive
2011-02-26 13:05:16	nadir	It did work.
2011-02-26 13:05:23	nadir	I tested it on my main PC
2011-02-26 13:05:30	fsmithred	The xorg thingy is still a baby
2011-02-26 13:05:37	nadir	USB-stick was in, mp3-player too.
2011-02-26 13:05:42	nadir	quite a mess. :-)
2011-02-26 13:05:46	fsmithred	wow
2011-02-26 13:05:49	fsmithred	good
2011-02-26 13:05:49	nadir	I picked sdb for all
2011-02-26 13:05:50	fsmithred	thanks
2011-02-26 13:05:57	nadir	and there have been no problems.
2011-02-26 13:06:02	nadir	the last info was correct.
2011-02-26 13:06:11	fsmithred	well, you cant't hurt anything with that one
2011-02-26 13:06:13	fsmithred	yet
2011-02-26 13:06:28	nadir	that is why i picked my main OS.
2011-02-26 13:06:36	nadir	Less trouble to move the code around...
2011-02-26 13:06:43	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-26 13:07:11	fsmithred	I sort of promised you a gift...
2011-02-26 13:07:13	nadir	The persisting problem is that there is no "order" in how it lists the devices.
2011-02-26 13:07:22	nadir	no biggie, but a bit confusing.
2011-02-26 13:07:23	fsmithred	yeah, I noticed that
2011-02-26 13:07:30	nadir	you said it to me :-)
2011-02-26 13:07:32	fsmithred	maybe some way to add sort
2011-02-26 13:07:42	fsmithred	will have to look at that
2011-02-26 13:07:47	fsmithred	um, here's the deal
2011-02-26 13:07:54	fsmithred	you don't want to go to fdn
2011-02-26 13:08:04	nadir	ah, yes. usually not.
2011-02-26 13:08:11	fsmithred	I thought I'd mirror the site, tar it up and send it to you
2011-02-26 13:08:14	fsmithred	but...
2011-02-26 13:08:22	fsmithred	it's been downloading for about 30 hrs
2011-02-26 13:08:29	nadir	umpf...
2011-02-26 13:08:32	nadir	that is long.
2011-02-26 13:08:34	fsmithred	up to 2.7GB and still going
2011-02-26 13:08:52	fsmithred	it's running about 20KB/s
2011-02-26 13:08:54	nadir	that is rather not so good, or what do you say?
2011-02-26 13:09:14	fsmithred	well, I hate to stop it now, after all those hours
2011-02-26 13:09:20	nadir	yes, i see.
2011-02-26 13:09:29	fsmithred	but I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting more than I really want
2011-02-26 13:09:31	nadir	can i stop the download, and pick it up later?
2011-02-26 13:09:47	fsmithred	um
2011-02-26 13:09:49	nadir	or do i need to run it at once?
2011-02-26 13:09:53	fsmithred	how you gonna stop it from there?
2011-02-26 13:09:55	fsmithred	oh
2011-02-26 13:09:56	fsmithred	wget
2011-02-26 13:09:59	fsmithred	can be stopped
2011-02-26 13:10:12	nadir	aha.
2011-02-26 13:10:13	fsmithred	then wget -c (or maybe -C) to continue
2011-02-26 13:10:18	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 13:10:27	nadir	that sounds good.
2011-02-26 13:10:27	fsmithred	but here's what I was thinking
2011-02-26 13:10:30	nadir	or: great.
2011-02-26 13:10:34	nadir	yes?
2011-02-26 13:10:39	fsmithred	if I can get it all, put it on an external drive
2011-02-26 13:10:58	fsmithred	I can go to a friend's house, upload at high speed to someplace that has better download speed
2011-02-26 13:10:59	fsmithred	maybe
2011-02-26 13:11:06	fsmithred	still have to find that place
2011-02-26 13:11:26	nadir	you could try adrive.
2011-02-26 13:11:29	fsmithred	but maybe someone at duf could supply some server space for it
2011-02-26 13:11:30	nadir	not sure.
2011-02-26 13:11:36	fsmithred	what do I need to install?
2011-02-26 13:11:41	nadir	but with such huge files they often fail.
2011-02-26 13:11:43	nadir	nothing.
2011-02-26 13:11:50	nadir	you just make an account.
2011-02-26 13:11:59	fsmithred	oh, I thought you said I need jre or something like that
2011-02-26 13:12:05	nadir	it doesn't hurt to have got jave or java-free
2011-02-26 13:12:11	nadir	yes.
2011-02-26 13:12:23	nadir	but you can also use the simple-uploader, i think
2011-02-26 13:12:32	nadir	but, like said: which huge files it fails.
2011-02-26 13:12:34	nadir	not much fun
2011-02-26 13:12:41	nadir	(well: for me)
2011-02-26 13:13:03	fsmithred	yeah, maybe different with faster up speed
2011-02-26 13:15:51	nadir	My speed is usually ok.
2011-02-26 13:16:01	fsmithred	How fast up?
2011-02-26 13:16:09	nadir	But when i got too big files (say like a OS-iso)
2011-02-26 13:16:20	nadir	it often stops, and i got to restart the whole shit again.
2011-02-26 13:16:25	nadir	Let me check the speed.
2011-02-26 13:18:59	nadir	download 13,7 Mb
2011-02-26 13:19:07	nadir	upload 0.93 Mbp
2011-02-26 13:19:10	nadir	or similar.
2011-02-26 13:19:12	nadir	:-)
2011-02-26 13:19:20	fsmithred	pretty good
2011-02-26 13:19:44	nadir	yes.
2011-02-26 13:19:51	nadir	seen that way Germany is ok.
2011-02-26 13:20:04	fsmithred	yeah, we're in the stone-age here
2011-02-26 13:21:30	nadir	I got a Vbox-Machine for only installing.
2011-02-26 13:21:42	nadir	So, if you add the "real installing" i can test it.
2011-02-26 13:21:47	nadir	np.
2011-02-26 13:21:54	fsmithred	cool
2011-02-26 13:22:03	fsmithred	might get to that today or tomorrow
2011-02-26 13:22:07	nadir	uhum.
2011-02-26 13:22:16	nadir	After you gave me the zenity commands,
2011-02-26 13:22:23	nadir	all the rest was copy and paste.
2011-02-26 13:22:29	nadir	and then hunting for typos.
2011-02-26 13:23:00	nadir	different:
2011-02-26 13:23:08	nadir	i just added the code from the cli-installer
2011-02-26 13:23:15	nadir	(refractainstaller2.sh ?)
2011-02-26 13:23:22	fsmithred	that's pretty much all I have to do now
2011-02-26 13:25:06	fsmithred	https://github.com/fsmithred/refracta/blob/master/display_savior.02
2011-02-26 13:25:56	fsmithred	that one is real, not a dummy
2011-02-26 13:26:10	nadir	short  question: for radeon i need non-free, yes or no?
2011-02-26 13:26:31	fsmithred	there are only free drivers listed in that script
2011-02-26 13:26:54	nadir	no, if i  buy a laptop, and it has radeon chips, do i need non-free?
2011-02-26 13:27:02	nadir	(assuming i want compiz)
2011-02-26 13:27:05	fsmithred	not required
2011-02-26 13:27:11	nadir	ok, thanks.
2011-02-26 13:27:14	fsmithred	use radeon-hd
2011-02-26 13:27:18	fsmithred	should work, I think
2011-02-26 13:27:22	fsmithred	but maybe read up on it
2011-02-26 13:27:38	fsmithred	not sure if it has 3-D accel yet
2011-02-26 13:27:59	nadir	that is the problem. I want compiz.
2011-02-26 13:28:07	nadir	i know only intel.
2011-02-26 13:28:33	nadir	I am booting VBox, then i need to move the script, then i will run it.
2011-02-26 13:29:13	nadir	holy crap.
2011-02-26 13:29:28	nadir	your refracta directory is a nice piece of cool scripts
2011-02-26 13:29:39	fsmithred	yeah, it's getting big
2011-02-26 13:29:47	nadir	and lots of perls
2011-02-26 13:29:54	nadir	pearls?
2011-02-26 13:29:54	fsmithred	?
2011-02-26 13:30:00	nadir	well: good stuff.
2011-02-26 13:30:03	fsmithred	ok, pearls
2011-02-26 13:30:08	fsmithred	no perl there
2011-02-26 13:30:13	fsmithred	although...
2011-02-26 13:30:15	nadir	no: i meant pearls.
2011-02-26 13:30:19	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-26 13:30:26	fsmithred	I wrote todo-key.pl
2011-02-26 13:30:33	nadir	oh noze.
2011-02-26 13:30:38	nadir	give me a break.
2011-02-26 13:30:41	nadir	:-)
2011-02-26 13:30:43	fsmithred	retrieves lines by keyword from tasklist
2011-02-26 13:31:07	fsmithred	well, I was looking at the regex stuff
2011-02-26 13:31:30	fsmithred	and I once I figured out exercise 1, I only needed a little more to do it
2011-02-26 13:31:39	fsmithred	and found what I needed pretty easily
2011-02-26 13:33:09	nadir	when i reached the exercise i went back to input-output.
2011-02-26 13:33:17	nadir	Then i started to shout and scream in anger.
2011-02-26 13:33:20	nadir	Then i quit.
2011-02-26 13:33:24	fsmithred	yeah, no shit
2011-02-26 13:33:42	fsmithred	you got tele's example of inputting a file?
2011-02-26 13:33:54	nadir	mhh.. if yes then i don't know where.
2011-02-26 13:34:32	fsmithred	nobody is here, so I'm gonna break the rules and post it
2011-02-26 13:34:37	fsmithred	open my $input, '<', 'huggy';
2011-02-26 13:34:37	fsmithred	open my $output, '>>', 'dat.txt';
2011-02-26 13:34:38	fsmithred	while (<$input>) {
2011-02-26 13:34:38	fsmithred	    print $output $_; # no comma - print $_ TO $output
2011-02-26 13:34:38	fsmithred	}
2011-02-26 13:35:00	fsmithred	but that's only part of the problem
2011-02-26 13:35:19	fsmithred	also need a for (or foreach) loop
2011-02-26 13:35:34	fsmithred	and the book hasn't explained how to combine a while and a for together
2011-02-26 13:35:47	fsmithred	while blah {
2011-02-26 13:35:55	fsmithred	foreach blah {
2011-02-26 13:36:00	fsmithred	print stuff;
2011-02-26 13:36:06	fsmithred	}
2011-02-26 13:36:07	fsmithred	}
2011-02-26 13:36:33	fsmithred	I had to look at the solution in the appendix to figure it out
2011-02-26 13:36:44	fsmithred	and the book's solution doesn't use an input file
2011-02-26 13:36:48	fsmithred	fucker
2011-02-26 13:37:08	fsmithred	then he has the nerve to say that the important lesson is that it's case-sensitive
2011-02-26 13:37:17	fsmithred	clueless fucker
2011-02-26 13:38:11	fsmithred	did you know that stuff in linux is case-sensitive?
2011-02-26 13:38:22	fsmithred	big secret!
2011-02-26 13:38:39	nadir	ha.
2011-02-26 13:38:45	nadir	i know that.
2011-02-26 13:38:47	nadir	hurray.

2011-02-26 13:42:32	EvilDairyProduct	ran into the hun on the other channel and he scolded me for missing again
2011-02-26 13:42:41	nadir	huh?
2011-02-26 13:42:47	EvilDairyProduct	=)
2011-02-26 13:43:06	EvilDairyProduct	what did you work on today, nadir?
2011-02-26 13:43:17	nadir	regex/perl.
2011-02-26 13:43:28	nadir	and xchatting too.
2011-02-26 13:43:51	nadir	ah, i moved one VBox-install around. Sweaty hands.
2011-02-26 13:43:57	EvilDairyProduct	haha
2011-02-26 13:45:10	EvilDairyProduct	coffee relaod, brb
2011-02-26 13:46:42	nadir	k
2011-02-26 13:49:14	fsmithred	b
2011-02-26 13:49:21	fsmithred	for a minute
2011-02-26 13:50:15	fsmithred	for moving vbi, I was thinking maybe you don't have to make a whole new VM
2011-02-26 13:50:28	fsmithred	just add the new hard drive
2011-02-26 13:50:34	fsmithred	after you move it
2011-02-26 13:50:43	fsmithred	release the old one
2011-02-26 13:51:19	nadir	don't ask me.
2011-02-26 13:51:49	nadir	i ran the displaychooser
2011-02-26 13:55:32	fsmithred	did it work?
2011-02-26 13:55:50	nadir	well, kind of.
2011-02-26 13:55:54	nadir	I picked vesa
2011-02-26 13:56:23	nadir	Vbox does not seem to use xorg.conf anymore.
2011-02-26 13:56:25	fsmithred	that's all?
2011-02-26 13:56:33	nadir	no.
2011-02-26 13:56:33	fsmithred	???
2011-02-26 13:56:41	nadir	first things first.
2011-02-26 13:56:44	fsmithred	oh
2011-02-26 13:56:46	nadir	i ran it from gui.
2011-02-26 13:56:48	nadir	it stopped.
2011-02-26 13:56:50	nadir	X
2011-02-26 13:56:51	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 13:56:52	fsmithred	oops
2011-02-26 13:56:56	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-26 13:56:58	nadir	I logged out of X
2011-02-26 13:57:00	nadir	i ran it.
2011-02-26 13:57:08	nadir	then i came to think that i am in VBox
2011-02-26 13:57:18	nadir	I wanted to check xorg.conf, but none was there.
2011-02-26 13:57:25	nadir	So i picked vesa.
2011-02-26 13:57:33	nadir	and then my resolution.
2011-02-26 13:57:39	nadir	and skipped most of the rest.
2011-02-26 13:57:44	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-26 13:57:54	nadir	When i want to startx, or it happens automatically,
2011-02-26 13:57:54	fsmithred	you should be able to skip any or all parts
2011-02-26 13:58:00	nadir	i get a message gdm is running
2011-02-26 13:58:06	nadir	(but i stopped it)
2011-02-26 13:58:09	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-26 13:58:11	nadir	then X starts.
2011-02-26 13:58:18	nadir	which, for me, is always a success.
2011-02-26 13:58:23	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-26 13:58:28	nadir	so,
2011-02-26 13:58:34	nadir	the script itself does run.
2011-02-26 13:58:38	nadir	the questions are good.
2011-02-26 13:58:40	fsmithred	doesn't vbox use some virtual display device?
2011-02-26 13:58:45	nadir	yes,
2011-02-26 13:58:50	nadir	it used to use vboxvideo
2011-02-26 13:58:53	nadir	or similar.
2011-02-26 13:59:06	nadir	That is what i wanted to look, but then: oh? no xorg.conf no more.
2011-02-26 14:00:02	nadir	So,....
2011-02-26 14:00:11	fsmithred	I was testing on real hardware
2011-02-26 14:00:33	nadir	no i wanted to add "vboxvideo" to a) b) c) ..... h) vboxvideo ; break ,,
2011-02-26 14:00:38	nadir	but it did not work.
2011-02-26 14:00:44	fsmithred	guess I need to add more tests and instructions
2011-02-26 14:01:02	fsmithred	I just searched packages for vbox
2011-02-26 14:01:09	fsmithred	there's no vbox video driver
2011-02-26 14:01:14	fsmithred	there is one for vmware
2011-02-26 14:01:24	fsmithred	xserver-xorg-video-vmware
2011-02-26 14:02:03	nadir	i think it comes with guest-additions.
2011-02-26 14:02:11	fsmithred	oh, maybe
2011-02-26 14:03:18	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 14:03:25	nadir	Now i am at the restart of gdm
2011-02-26 14:03:35	nadir	It says there would be a gdm running already.
2011-02-26 14:03:40	nadir	I am stuck there.
2011-02-26 14:03:49	nadir	I say yes. i get the same info.
2011-02-26 14:03:56	nadir	I say no. i get the same info.
2011-02-26 14:04:33	fsmithred	yeah, I assumed that gdm would be present
2011-02-26 14:04:35	nadir	and finally, via magic, X starts.
2011-02-26 14:04:53	fsmithred	you don't have gdm installed?
2011-02-26 14:05:26	nadir	yes, i have.
2011-02-26 14:05:38	nadir	It says: it is already running.
2011-02-26 14:05:59	fsmithred	beginning of script should stop it
2011-02-26 14:06:04	fsmithred	end of script starts it
2011-02-26 14:07:01	nadir	yes.
2011-02-26 14:07:31	nadir	but i made the changes (Added vboxvideo)
2011-02-26 14:07:47	nadir	this time picked the right choice ( c for 1366x768)
2011-02-26 14:07:50	nadir	and it is ok.
2011-02-26 14:08:04	nadir	It has been ok before that too.. . but still a success.
2011-02-26 14:08:06	nadir	And:
2011-02-26 14:08:20	nadir	If i pick another resoltuion, i get another one.
2011-02-26 14:08:22	nadir	also good.
2011-02-26 14:08:27	fsmithred	cool
2011-02-26 14:08:31	nadir	yup
2011-02-26 14:08:41	nadir	the kms is probably cool.
2011-02-26 14:08:54	nadir	i skip it, but i think it might come in very handy.
2011-02-26 14:08:55	fsmithred	that one was tricky to figure out
2011-02-26 14:09:11	fsmithred	had to resort to double-quotes for sed
2011-02-26 14:10:05	fsmithred	I'm looking at the list of xserver packages
2011-02-26 14:10:24	fsmithred	thinking I should probably add a section to install the right one if it's not there
2011-02-26 14:10:34	nadir	i added "vboxvideo" and it did  not complain.
2011-02-26 14:10:46	nadir	vbox is very picky with errors in xorg.conf.
2011-02-26 14:10:58	nadir	so: vboxvideo should be right.
2011-02-26 14:11:09	fsmithred	yeah, for that case
2011-02-26 14:11:21	fsmithred	I'm looking at what's installed in refracta
2011-02-26 14:11:25	fsmithred	radeon-hd is not
2011-02-26 14:11:45	fsmithred	several older or oddball ones are not
2011-02-26 14:13:35	fsmithred	so
2011-02-26 14:13:52	fsmithred	add some code to deal with users who don't use a display manager
2011-02-26 14:14:03	fsmithred	add some code to deal with missing drivers
2011-02-26 14:14:21	fsmithred	maybe have a section "other" and let them type it in
2011-02-26 14:15:04	fsmithred	I need to see how lspci reports all these things
2011-02-26 14:16:07	fsmithred	actually, I need to hear from dean first, to know if this is the kind of thing he wants
2011-02-26 14:16:41	fsmithred	before I write another couple hundred lines
2011-02-26 14:18:13	fsmithred	um
2011-02-26 14:18:16	nadir	what i like now is that the questions are understandable.
2011-02-26 14:18:25	nadir	I am very bad with that, and i had no problems.
2011-02-26 14:18:35	nadir	just pick via letter.
2011-02-26 14:18:39	fsmithred	it's supposed to test for a pid for gdm before it stops it
2011-02-26 14:18:48	fsmithred	so
2011-02-26 14:18:52	fsmithred	if you weren't running gdm
2011-02-26 14:18:53	nadir	huh?
2011-02-26 14:18:55	nadir	where?
2011-02-26 14:18:58	fsmithred	how did it kill your display
2011-02-26 14:19:06	nadir	/etc/init.d/gdm stop
2011-02-26 14:19:07	fsmithred	right after the first read -p
2011-02-26 14:19:22	fsmithred	you using the one I posted code in the forum?
2011-02-26 14:19:26	fsmithred	or the one on github?
2011-02-26 14:19:41	nadir	the github one
2011-02-26 14:19:44	nadir	i hope
2011-02-26 14:19:59	nadir	$ pwd
2011-02-26 14:19:59	nadir	/home/m1arkust/Programming/Bash/Git/fsmithred/refracta
2011-02-26 14:20:09	fsmithred	# Test if gdm is running; if so, stop it.
2011-02-26 14:20:09	fsmithred	if ps -C gdm; then
2011-02-26 14:20:09	fsmithred	  /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2011-02-26 14:20:09	fsmithred	  sleep 3
2011-02-26 14:20:09	fsmithred	fi
2011-02-26 14:20:17	fsmithred	https://github.com/fsmithred/refracta/blob/master/display_savior.02
2011-02-26 14:20:25	nadir	yes, the if-fi i got.
2011-02-26 14:20:40	fsmithred	so then you must have been running gdm
2011-02-26 14:20:49	nadir	what?
2011-02-26 14:21:01	nadir	if i do /etc/init.d/gdm stop it stops, or not?
2011-02-26 14:21:03	fsmithred	oh wait
2011-02-26 14:21:18	nadir	let me run it without stoping init.d
2011-02-26 14:21:23	fsmithred	yeah, I guess it would, but that command shouldn't run if gdm does not have a pid
2011-02-26 14:22:00	nadir	on a side note: login managers suck, nothing but trouble.
2011-02-26 14:22:32	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-26 14:22:59	nadir	same problem.
2011-02-26 14:23:07	nadir	No biggie, just a bit confusing.
2011-02-26 14:23:13	fsmithred	I'm gonna test it
2011-02-26 14:23:14	nadir	Perhaps a vbox-thing.
2011-02-26 14:23:19	nadir	perhaps a refracta thing.
2011-02-26 14:23:23	nadir	I don't know.
2011-02-26 14:23:31	nadir	ah, perhaps a pebcak
2011-02-26 14:23:43	nadir	s/c/k and vice versa.
2011-02-26 14:26:07	fsmithred	hm... stopping gdm does not stop it from running
2011-02-26 14:26:16	fsmithred	there are still three processes listed
2011-02-26 14:26:20	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 14:26:29	nadir	case closed. Dean borked it.
2011-02-26 14:26:31	nadir	:-)
2011-02-26 14:27:10	fsmithred	oh my
2011-02-26 14:27:14	fsmithred	user sees three
2011-02-26 14:27:21	fsmithred	root sees only 'grep gdm'
2011-02-26 14:27:33	fsmithred	wtf?
2011-02-26 14:27:51	fsmithred	this is on debian, not refracta
2011-02-26 14:29:24	fsmithred	oh, it gets weirder
2011-02-26 14:29:34	fsmithred	date on these processes is Feb 20
2011-02-26 14:29:35	nadir	ah. ok.
2011-02-26 14:29:43	fsmithred	and I rebooted about a dozen times last night
2011-02-26 14:29:48	fsmithred	and this morning
2011-02-26 14:29:56	nadir	but on refracta i got several gdm-processes running too.
2011-02-26 14:30:03	nadir	3, as far i can tell.
2011-02-26 14:30:32	fsmithred	yeah, two /usr/sbin/gdm plus on /usr/bin/X blah -auth blah
2011-02-26 14:30:44	nadir	yup
2011-02-26 14:30:55	fsmithred	owned by root
2011-02-26 14:31:03	fsmithred	but pkill gdm didn't get rid of them
2011-02-26 14:32:40	nadir	i think you can use startx, and that will start gdm again.
2011-02-26 14:32:41	fsmithred	shit
2011-02-26 14:32:54	fsmithred	I'm trying to do this over ssh
2011-02-26 14:32:59	nadir	at the bottom of the script.
2011-02-26 14:33:00	fsmithred	in two terminals
2011-02-26 14:33:05	nadir	instead of gdm, startx.
2011-02-26 14:33:06	fsmithred	one for root, one for user
2011-02-26 14:33:13	fsmithred	user is not logged into the other machine
2011-02-26 14:33:15	fsmithred	duh
2011-02-26 14:33:54	fsmithred	ok, no gdm running
2011-02-26 14:33:56	fsmithred	for real
2011-02-26 14:35:09	fsmithred	startx (run on the remote machine's keyboard, not over ssh) gives me a black screen
2011-02-26 14:35:23	fsmithred	um, maybe I really do need the nomodeset
2011-02-26 14:35:28	fsmithred	I'm running without it right now
2011-02-26 14:36:06	fsmithred	yeah, black screen with a movable cursor
2011-02-26 14:36:12	fsmithred	but no action
2011-02-26 14:36:27	fsmithred	ok, no gdm running
2011-02-26 14:37:51	nadir	i tested it, replacing the last line (gdm start) with startx gets rid of the error-message
2011-02-26 14:38:01	fsmithred	cool
2011-02-26 14:38:15	nadir	but: it startx as root.
2011-02-26 14:38:16	nadir	duh.
2011-02-26 14:38:36	fsmithred	oh shit
2011-02-26 14:38:50	nadir	might be i was not logged in as user.
2011-02-26 14:39:00	fsmithred	ok, mine is rebooting
2011-02-26 14:40:38	nadir	ok, the startx is not perfect neither.
2011-02-26 14:41:32	fsmithred	ok, startx works now, after booting with nomodeset
2011-02-26 14:41:37	fsmithred	and no gdm running
2011-02-26 14:41:42	fsmithred	so I'll try the script again
2011-02-26 14:42:42	fsmithred	got it
2011-02-26 14:42:55	fsmithred	"There already appears to be an X server running
2011-02-26 14:42:59	fsmithred	which is true
2011-02-26 14:43:09	fsmithred	the desktop didn't get killed when I ran the script
2011-02-26 14:43:21	fsmithred	one fix would be to change the last line to "restart"
2011-02-26 14:43:27	fsmithred	but that won't do what you want
2011-02-26 14:43:34	fsmithred	that'll still start gdm
2011-02-26 14:43:45	nadir	did you try?
2011-02-26 14:43:50	fsmithred	no
2011-02-26 14:43:56	fsmithred	but I can run it from command line
2011-02-26 14:44:44	nadir	works for me.
2011-02-26 14:44:47	nadir	perfect.
2011-02-26 14:45:35	fsmithred	ok, /etc/init.d/gdm stop does not kill the desktop
2011-02-26 14:45:50	nadir	restart works.
2011-02-26 14:45:55	nadir	last line.
2011-02-26 14:45:58	nadir	at minimum here.
2011-02-26 14:46:20	fsmithred	not here
2011-02-26 14:46:28	fsmithred	I'm getting the message that X is already running
2011-02-26 14:47:09	nadir	well: i ran the script a few times in a row. Perhaps it finally killed all processes....
2011-02-26 14:47:10	fsmithred	killing the pid of xinit did it
2011-02-26 14:48:11	fsmithred	xinit runs if you use startx, but not if you use gdm
2011-02-26 14:48:20	fsmithred	so I should test for both of those
2011-02-26 14:48:34	fsmithred	and use appropriate commands
2011-02-26 14:48:43	fsmithred	depending on which it finds
2011-02-26 14:48:57	fsmithred	need to make notes
2011-02-26 14:49:16	nadir	uhum.
2011-02-26 14:49:29	nadir	whew. very difficult.
2011-02-26 14:49:43	nadir	lots of fiddling, and all  that with an us-keyboard...
2011-02-26 14:50:11	EvilDairyProduct	nadir: just flipping through the debian distrowatch review thread at linuxforums
2011-02-26 14:50:15	EvilDairyProduct	ubuntards there too =(
2011-02-26 14:50:28	nadir	yup, they reach for world domination.
2011-02-26 14:50:55	EvilDairyProduct	i do not post at butnut forums, so it is still confusing for me why they post on debian boards
2011-02-26 14:51:17	nadir	yup.
2011-02-26 14:51:25	nadir	and if i post there i oftne make mistakes.
2011-02-26 14:51:29	fsmithred	well, mostly it's the ones who are tempted to try debian
2011-02-26 14:51:38	nadir	but then i don't start to piss about them, but see that it is my fault.
2011-02-26 14:51:51	fsmithred	well...
2011-02-26 14:51:55	fsmithred	you're an adult
2011-02-26 14:52:04	EvilDairyProduct	i am a manchild
2011-02-26 14:52:10	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-26 14:52:18	EvilDairyProduct	i am ok with that =P
2011-02-26 14:52:47	nadir	fsmithred, the more i boot into refracta-gnome-the-super-blue-version
2011-02-26 14:52:50	nadir	the more i like it.
2011-02-26 14:52:52	fsmithred	nadir - how about if the script ends and tells you it's ok now to run startx as user?
2011-02-26 14:53:02	nadir	yup.
2011-02-26 14:53:07	fsmithred	cool
2011-02-26 14:53:11	EvilDairyProduct	nadir: is that the 6.02 refracta or yet another build?
2011-02-26 14:53:16	nadir	i meant: yup, good if it works.
2011-02-26 14:53:30	nadir	I guess yes, but i would have guessed a lot of what we just did woudl work.
2011-02-26 14:53:57	fsmithred	yeah, but anyone running startx should probably be left at command line.
2011-02-26 14:54:11	fsmithred	I'll also put a warning in the beginning that you need to run it from console
2011-02-26 14:54:24	nadir	to be honest:
2011-02-26 14:54:28	nadir	that confused me a bit.
2011-02-26 14:54:34	nadir	the stopping of gdm
2011-02-26 14:54:37	nadir	i am at the cli
2011-02-26 14:54:43	nadir	and the script is dead.
2011-02-26 14:54:47	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-26 14:54:49	nadir	nothing un-doable.
2011-02-26 14:54:54	nadir	but a wee bit confusing.
2011-02-26 14:55:05	nadir	I ran the script for, say, 15 times now
2011-02-26 14:55:09	nadir	and it is nice and easy.
2011-02-26 14:55:16	fsmithred	I'll add proper instructions for aunt martha or her nephew
2011-02-26 14:55:26	nadir	those i had in mind.
2011-02-26 14:56:14	fsmithred	originally, I thought about having the script run automatically if X does not start
2011-02-26 14:56:18	nadir	wait... i think i am her nephew...
2011-02-26 14:56:19	fsmithred	not sure how to do that
2011-02-26 14:56:23	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-26 14:56:27	fsmithred	yes, you are
2011-02-26 14:56:36	nadir	check the link i added at refracta forum
2011-02-26 14:56:43	nadir	there is a way to check if X is running.
2011-02-26 14:59:43	fsmithred	if [[ -n $DISPLAY ]]; then echo "yes display" ; else echo "no display";fiyes display
2011-02-26 14:59:50	fsmithred	oops
2011-02-26 14:59:54	fsmithred	too much got copied
2011-02-26 14:59:59	fsmithred	you got the answer
2011-02-26 15:00:02	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 15:00:04	fsmithred	I'm seeing a black screen
2011-02-26 15:01:06	nadir	aha.
2011-02-26 15:01:18	nadir	that is often a sign that something is wrong.
2011-02-26 15:01:22	nadir	:-)
2011-02-26 15:01:45	fsmithred	lol, yeah
2011-02-26 15:01:49	fsmithred	I can't find the process
2011-02-26 15:02:21	fsmithred	where is this link?
2011-02-26 15:02:29	EvilDairyProduct	just joined refracta board as MilkGoneBad
2011-02-26 15:02:29	fsmithred	you mean the discussion from fdn?

2011-02-26 15:04:11	fsmithred	yeah, I'm trying it
2011-02-26 15:04:14	nadir	ok.
2011-02-26 15:04:24	fsmithred	no /tmp/.X0-lock
2011-02-26 15:04:49	nadir	don'T do all the work. Leave a bit for Dean.
2011-02-26 15:05:22	nadir	to put it different: perhaps he remembers what it is about the /tmp files.
2011-02-26 15:05:40	nadir	cause i for sure don'T
2011-02-26 15:05:47	fsmithred	well, I finally hammered it into place
2011-02-26 15:05:51	fsmithred	with 'init 1'
2011-02-26 15:05:59	fsmithred	but that's not really a solution
2011-02-26 15:06:06	fsmithred	killed my ssh connection
2011-02-26 15:07:11	nadir	wait a moment. If you use ssh you can startx? How that?
2011-02-26 15:07:51	fsmithred	no, I have to reach over behind me and grab another keyboard for startx
2011-02-26 15:07:53	fsmithred	and login
2011-02-26 15:08:00	fsmithred	but I can restart/stop gdm
2011-02-26 15:08:01	nadir	ah,ok. got it.
2011-02-26 15:08:05	fsmithred	find pid, etc
2011-02-26 15:08:07	fsmithred	over ssh
2011-02-26 15:08:16	fsmithred	run the script over ssh, too
2011-02-26 15:10:02	fsmithred	ps -C xinit -opid=
2011-02-26 15:10:22	fsmithred	kill $(ps -C xinit -opid=)
2011-02-26 15:10:44	fsmithred	yes!
2011-02-26 15:12:24	fsmithred	here's what I think
2011-02-26 15:12:29	fsmithred	test for gdm or xinit
2011-02-26 15:12:39	fsmithred	set a variable to tell if person is using dm or not
2011-02-26 15:13:01	fsmithred	at end, use that var to decide whether to restart dm or just give the message about startx

2011-02-26 17:12:21	@telemachus	You can associate one gravatar image with multiple emails, if you like.
2011-02-26 17:12:38	@telemachus	I do that so no matter what email I use anywhere, my gravatar is reasonably consistent.
2011-02-26 17:12:55	@telemachus	Though for 90% of code stuff, I use the one email.

2011-02-27 07:53:35	nadir	yes.
2011-02-27 07:53:36	nadir	i booted into it, thought: mhhh.. what shall i do.
2011-02-27 07:53:36	nadir	perlbrew was my first idea.
2011-02-27 07:54:10	nadir	but it takes forever.
2011-02-27 07:55:51	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 07:55:55	@telemachus	age hurts
2011-02-27 07:56:00	@telemachus	the processor
2011-02-27 07:56:05	nadir	yup.
2011-02-27 07:56:14	nadir	I am not what one would call patient...
2011-02-27 07:56:15	@telemachus	also it may not have all the prereqs for 5.12.3 - not sure about that
2011-02-27 07:56:33	nadir	oh noze... don't tell me it will fail in the end....
2011-02-27 07:57:39	@telemachus	I'm not sure

2011-02-27 07:57:58	nadir	grml...
2011-02-27 07:58:01	nadir	We will see.

2011-02-27 08:01:16	@telemachus	while it's chugging, open another terminal window, please and check: which curl and which wget
2011-02-27 08:01:22	@telemachus	You will need one of those
2011-02-27 08:01:26	nadir	ok. chief.
2011-02-27 08:01:51	@telemachus	also as I recall Perlbrew will work out of the box with Bash or Zsh, but you have tclsh don't you?
2011-02-27 08:01:56	@telemachus	fucking tickle shell
2011-02-27 08:01:57	nadir	no.
2011-02-27 08:02:04	nadir	I went back to Debian.
2011-02-27 08:02:14	@telemachus	Ah! Then you're fine, never mind.
2011-02-27 08:02:17	nadir	propeltrottel OS gave me the business.
2011-02-27 08:02:23	nadir	I thought: wtf?
2011-02-27 08:02:30	nadir	and installed Debian.
2011-02-27 08:02:36	nadir	I tried dual-boot. No luck.
2011-02-27 08:03:14	nadir	If you install apps,
2011-02-27 08:03:21	nadir	you do things like : dmg?
2011-02-27 08:03:23	nadir	dms?
2011-02-27 08:03:29	nadir	like that. That did not work.
2011-02-27 08:04:07	nadir	I shouted, i screamed, but it did not work.
2011-02-27 08:04:07	nadir	If there would be Mac-users in Germany, ok.
2011-02-27 08:04:11	nadir	But as there are not very much: i thought: why should i go through that.
2011-02-27 08:05:22	@telemachus	dmg for new macs, yours is probably too old
2011-02-27 08:05:33	@telemachus	Apple tends to abandon older releases relatively quickly
2011-02-27 08:05:39	@telemachus	and by their standard, yours is ancient
2011-02-27 08:06:05	@telemachus	they abandoned long ago
2011-02-27 08:06:10	@telemachus	sad to say
2011-02-27 08:06:15	nadir	ah. ok.
2011-02-27 08:06:23	@telemachus	so it would be very difficul to work with under almost any circumstances
2011-02-27 08:06:32	@telemachus	unless you were an extreme Apple hobbyist
2011-02-27 08:06:41	@telemachus	with lots of knowledge and old material
2011-02-27 08:06:49	@telemachus	(old programs, installers, etc.)
2011-02-27 08:06:57	nadir	Thing is: i stilll need to learn a lot about Debian.
2011-02-27 08:07:14	nadir	After BSD i made up my mind and decided to stick to Debian and Debian-based.
2011-02-27 08:08:47	@telemachus	cool
2011-02-27 08:09:37	nadir	In case it helps you to get over it (which i  hope):
2011-02-27 08:09:50	nadir	we got a high waste of admins and custodians at the forum.
2011-02-27 08:10:01	nadir	No one seems to be able to do it for more than a few days.
2011-02-27 08:10:03	nadir	ha ha ha.
2011-02-27 08:10:16	nadir	So: seems like you did not do much wrong at forums,debian.net.
2011-02-27 08:10:53	@telemachus	laughs
2011-02-27 08:10:59	@telemachus	nah, I did plenty wrong
2011-02-27 08:11:03	nadir	Yeah, i think it is funny too.
2011-02-27 08:11:19	@telemachus	wait: what's a "high waste"?
2011-02-27 08:11:23	@telemachus	a loss?
2011-02-27 08:11:28	nadir	They resign
2011-02-27 08:11:28	@telemachus	high loss rate?
2011-02-27 08:11:31	nadir	yes
2011-02-27 08:11:35	@telemachus	oh
2011-02-27 08:11:39	@telemachus	misunderstood
2011-02-27 08:11:42	nadir	Tehy do stuff, people moan, they resign.
2011-02-27 08:11:42	@telemachus	who quit?
2011-02-27 08:11:48	nadir	dean himself
2011-02-27 08:11:50	nadir	cynwulf
2011-02-27 08:11:55	@telemachus	really?
2011-02-27 08:11:56	nadir	but now cynwulf is admin
2011-02-27 08:11:58	@telemachus	wow
2011-02-27 08:11:59	@telemachus	oh
2011-02-27 08:11:59	nadir	yes, really.
2011-02-27 08:12:03	@telemachus	so he didn't quit?
2011-02-27 08:12:03	nadir	yes: wow
2011-02-27 08:12:14	@telemachus	I am confuse
2011-02-27 08:12:15	nadir	cynwulf quit being an custodian
2011-02-27 08:12:19	@telemachus	why?
2011-02-27 08:12:21	nadir	tonight Dean resigned
2011-02-27 08:12:27	nadir	cynwulf became admin.
2011-02-27 08:12:29	@telemachus	in a fight?
2011-02-27 08:12:37	nadir	you can be confused, it is not understandable.
2011-02-27 08:12:39	nadir	Not sure,
2011-02-27 08:12:46	nadir	i don't think there was a fight.
2011-02-27 08:12:52	nadir	Migth well be i am the culprit.
2011-02-27 08:13:32	nadir	think of him what you want, but it sure would be a loss.
2011-02-27 08:14:32	nadir	.
2011-02-27 08:14:32	nadir	My point was/is:
2011-02-27 08:14:32	nadir	That are kind of people not easy to deal with.
2011-02-27 08:14:32	nadir	We will see if the forum will work at all.
2011-02-27 08:14:33	nadir	i got my doubts.
2011-02-27 08:15:05	nadir	So i would not think to bad of myself, if i was you.
2011-02-27 08:16:23	@telemachus	Ah
2011-02-27 08:16:26	@telemachus	well, I appreciate taht
2011-02-27 08:16:27	@telemachus	that
2011-02-27 08:16:28	@telemachus	even
2011-02-27 08:16:37	@telemachus	I'm mostly trying very hard not to think about all/any of it
2011-02-27 08:16:42	@telemachus	and just learn new things
2011-02-27 08:16:43	@telemachus	work
2011-02-27 08:16:48	nadir	oh, sorry.
2011-02-27 08:17:01	nadir	but it is rather a funny story.
2011-02-27 08:17:26	nadir	pure chaos.
2011-02-27 08:17:34	@telemachus	no need to be sorry
2011-02-27 08:17:39	@telemachus	I'm not saying shut up
2011-02-27 08:17:52	@telemachus	I'm saying "Don't worry about me too much with forums. I'm almost over them."
2011-02-27 08:18:01	@telemachus	It's like a drug - or a bad break up. Takes a bit.
2011-02-27 08:18:23	nadir	uhum.
2011-02-27 08:18:29	nadir	one perl-question?
2011-02-27 08:18:38	nadir	or rather not?
2011-02-27 08:19:06	@telemachus	sure, just one for now though
2011-02-27 08:19:14	@telemachus	got to get coffee and wrestle with a database
2011-02-27 08:19:15	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-27 08:19:16	nadir	its easy.
2011-02-27 08:19:19	nadir	the chapter says:
2011-02-27 08:19:56	nadir	$_ = "yabba dabba duh"
2011-02-27 08:19:56	nadir	if (/dabb/) {
2011-02-27 08:19:56	nadir	print "match" }
2011-02-27 08:19:56	nadir	so far, so good.
2011-02-27 08:19:57	nadir	but what if i want to call it different than $_
2011-02-27 08:19:59	nadir	say:
2011-02-27 08:20:07	nadir	my $whatever = "yes" ;
2011-02-27 08:20:08	@telemachus	smart
2011-02-27 08:20:11	@telemachus	good question
2011-02-27 08:20:36	@telemachus	if ($whatever =~ /[Yy]es/) { say "Foo!"; }
2011-02-27 08:20:42	@telemachus	for example
2011-02-27 08:20:49	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-02-27 08:20:50	nadir	thanks
2011-02-27 08:20:53	nadir	=~
2011-02-27 08:20:55	@telemachus	you need the match operator =~
2011-02-27 08:20:56	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 08:21:01	nadir	means "fits to an regex" ?
2011-02-27 08:21:05	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 08:21:10	nadir	ok.
2011-02-27 08:21:12	nadir	good.
2011-02-27 08:21:20	@telemachus	it returns true if there's a match and false otherwise
2011-02-27 08:21:28	@telemachus	(sort of)
2011-02-27 08:21:37	nadir	for now it  is good enough for me.
2011-02-27 08:21:43	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 08:21:44	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-27 08:21:59	@telemachus	you and your yes/no questions
2011-02-27 08:22:00	@telemachus	too funny
2011-02-27 08:22:09	@telemachus	it's the German in you, I think
2011-02-27 08:22:22	nadir	I learn such things more by doing, than by understanding.
2011-02-27 08:22:22	nadir	I don't care about the "exact" way to name it.
2011-02-27 08:22:22	nadir	but about the exact way to do it.
2011-02-27 08:22:23	nadir	So to speak.
2011-02-27 08:22:27	nadir	yes.
2011-02-27 08:22:29	nadir	probably.
2011-02-27 08:22:34	nadir	It is very strong in me.
2011-02-27 08:22:59	nadir	I am searching for being sure about things, i guess.
2011-02-27 08:23:11	@telemachus	fair enough
2011-02-27 08:23:30	@telemachus	no objection - I was really thinking of the tendency of your programs to ask the user lots of yes/no questions
2011-02-27 08:23:41	nadir	ha.
2011-02-27 08:23:44	nadir	yes, you are right.
2011-02-27 08:23:50	nadir	A good example.
2011-02-27 08:24:07	nadir	I loved that in the regex chapter.
2011-02-27 08:24:15	nadir	It either matches, or it does not match.
2011-02-27 08:24:28	nadir	No nearly-but-almost-but-not-really wishy-washy.
2011-02-27 08:24:36	nadir	It matches, or it matches not.
2011-02-27 08:25:43	 *	telemachus nods
2011-02-27 08:26:21	@telemachus	Ok, coffee, then database
2011-02-27 08:26:26	@telemachus	I'm around - back later for class
2011-02-27 08:26:29	nadir	ok, later.
2011-02-27 08:26:43	nadir	i will shut down the OS, after perlbrew is done.
2011-02-27 08:31:44	@telemachus	give it a little rest

2011-02-27 10:38:52	fsmithred	been playing with zenity some more
2011-02-27 10:39:09	fsmithred	you used progress bars at all?
2011-02-27 10:40:48	huggy-bear	yes, i did
2011-02-27 10:41:12	fsmithred	sometimes they work right for me, and sometimes not
2011-02-27 10:41:19	huggy-bear	but I only needed a crude one, so I just made a counter that would always echo and zenity would just use that value for the bar
2011-02-27 10:41:35	fsmithred	I've been using --pulsate
2011-02-27 10:41:42	fsmithred	but it doesn't always pulsate

2011-02-27 10:42:40	fsmithred	yeah, don't feel bad about that - I'm pretty sure the debian developers havn't figured out progress bars yet
2011-02-27 10:42:52	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 10:43:03	fsmithred	install always hangs at 33%
2011-02-27 10:43:16	fsmithred	then zooms through the remainder
2011-02-27 10:43:31	huggy-bear	there is 1 console command (i forgot the name) where you can pipe any command to it and it gives a progress bar
2011-02-27 10:43:46	fsmithred	whoa
2011-02-27 10:43:47	huggy-bear	dunno if that could be piped to zenity somehow
2011-02-27 10:43:58	fsmithred	gonna look for that
2011-02-27 10:44:03	huggy-bear	but for the love of cookie, I can't remember the name
2011-02-27 10:44:39	fsmithred	Curses::UI::Progressbar (3pm) - Create and manipulate progressbar widgets
2011-02-27 10:44:42	fsmithred	that?
2011-02-27 10:45:04	fsmithred	debconf-apt-progress (1) - install packages using debconf to display a progress bar
2011-02-27 10:45:24	huggy-bear	hmm, not sure. maybe
2011-02-27 10:46:29	huggy-bear	this sounds nice: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=316707
2011-02-27 10:50:29	huggy-bear	or maybe I rather meant the watch command: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Watch_%28Unix%29
2011-02-27 10:50:49	fsmithred	oh shit, I didn't know rsync has a progress option
2011-02-27 10:51:02	huggy-bear	:D
2011-02-27 10:51:03	fsmithred	that might be perfect
2011-02-27 10:51:23	fsmithred	since rsync is the longest part of the script
2011-02-27 10:52:14	huggy-bear	neat
2011-02-27 10:59:10	fsmithred	well, it works, I guess, but with a bunch of files, it doesn't stick around long enough to read it
2011-02-27 10:59:35	fsmithred	could get pretty much the same effect from using -v, and seeing the files that are being transferred
2011-02-27 10:59:51	fsmithred	works good for big files
2011-02-27 11:02:31	huggy-bear	well
2011-02-27 11:02:55	huggy-bear	the only script where I used the progress bar had a for loop anyway
2011-02-27 11:03:10	huggy-bear	so I just made a counter whose number would echo.
2011-02-27 11:03:22	huggy-bear	and add 1 each time
2011-02-27 11:04:15	fsmithred	and it added to the progress bar?
2011-02-27 11:04:21	huggy-bear	yes
2011-02-27 11:04:28	huggy-bear	let me show you the script
2011-02-27 11:04:32	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-27 11:07:46	huggy-bear	http://paste.debian.net/109016/
2011-02-27 11:08:08	huggy-bear	look at 2.1.1. under else
2011-02-27 11:08:38	huggy-bear	echo $n is used as the starting point for the progress bar's value
2011-02-27 11:09:13	fsmithred	what's auto-kill do?
2011-02-27 11:09:16	huggy-bear	everything starting with a # in echo will be shown by the progress bar as text, so I just used it to show the current file name
2011-02-27 11:09:21	huggy-bear	echo "# Processing file: $f"
2011-02-27 11:09:41	huggy-bear	i forgot, lemme check the man page :D
2011-02-27 11:10:00	huggy-bear	Kill parent process if cancel button is pressed
2011-02-27 11:10:15	huggy-bear	as you can see, you just pipe the loop into zenity
2011-02-27 11:10:36	fsmithred	yeah, I've been able to do that in some situations
2011-02-27 11:10:40	huggy-bear	this is cool if you don't need a very exact value for the prog bar
2011-02-27 11:11:01	huggy-bear	you can do more complex things with let, but it just didn't work for me
2011-02-27 11:11:09	fsmithred	with the installer script, I've got a check_exit function after almost every command
2011-02-27 11:11:14	huggy-bear	(and I also just copied that, so I really don't even know how that works)
2011-02-27 11:11:53	huggy-bear	yes, that would work
2011-02-27 11:12:19	huggy-bear	maybe you could make the script return one echo for every package it installed. or maybe just for 1 task.
2011-02-27 11:12:30	huggy-bear	experiment a bit and see how verbose that will be.
2011-02-27 11:12:51	fsmithred	yeah, I need to break it down to experiment with zenity
2011-02-27 11:13:15	huggy-bear	what complicates all that are the functions you are using
2011-02-27 11:13:18	fsmithred	first half of the script is just asking questions to decide on partitions to use, fs type
2011-02-27 11:13:22	huggy-bear	wouldn't know how that'd tie into it
2011-02-27 11:13:40	huggy-bear	well, u don't really need a progress bar for that
2011-02-27 11:13:59	fsmithred	second half is mke2fs, tune2fs, rsync, mount,
2011-02-27 11:14:18	fsmithred	chroot and grub-install/update-grub
2011-02-27 11:14:30	fsmithred	kinda hard to test that shit
2011-02-27 11:14:40	huggy-bear	i can imagine
2011-02-27 11:14:46	huggy-bear	apt-get at least has a dry run
2011-02-27 11:14:46	fsmithred	gotta do it in a vm
2011-02-27 11:14:52	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-27 11:15:11	fsmithred	this one is for installing live-cd to hard drive
2011-02-27 11:15:30	huggy-bear	oh yeah
2011-02-27 11:15:38	huggy-bear	then it's just rsync basically
2011-02-27 11:15:39	huggy-bear	right?
2011-02-27 11:15:51	fsmithred	yeah, that's the biggie
2011-02-27 11:16:03	fsmithred	but there's a bunch of other stuff around it
2011-02-27 11:17:46	huggy-bear	well, you'll figure it out eventually
2011-02-27 11:18:08	fsmithred	yeah, for now, if you start it in a terminal, you get messages
2011-02-27 11:18:40	fsmithred	and if you want to start it from a menu or panel button, set it to run in terminal
2011-02-27 11:18:42	fsmithred	all set
2011-02-27 11:19:16	huggy-bear	better to take up gtk soon, hehe. I gotta do something now. See you later.

2011-02-27 11:48:02	nadir	switching back and forth from bash to perl is killing me...

2011-02-27 11:48:50	nadir	yeah, I will go for tests as soon as possible.
2011-02-27 11:48:55	fsmithred	right now working on changing the message for check_exit
2011-02-27 11:49:15	fsmithred	just adding mention of where the error log is
2011-02-27 11:49:32	nadir	thats good.
2011-02-27 11:49:41	nadir	not that i would read logs, but still.

2011-02-27 11:57:09	nadir	better than porn.

2011-02-27 11:57:24	huggy-bear	hahaha
2011-02-27 11:57:30	huggy-bear	fsmithred: why the dot?
2011-02-27 11:57:38	fsmithred	back references
2011-02-27 11:57:49	fsmithred	I'm kinda lost with those
2011-02-27 11:58:06	fsmithred	might be a mental block, because I got really pissed off the first time I read through it
2011-02-27 11:58:23	fsmithred	he started talking about them without saying what the fuck they were
2011-02-27 11:58:46	fsmithred	then I blew a fuse over the first exercise
2011-02-27 11:59:00	fsmithred	spent 90 minutes working on it
2011-02-27 11:59:13	fsmithred	looking for the answer
2011-02-27 11:59:32	fsmithred	finally checked the appendix, and he used a construction that doesn't get shown until the next chapter
2011-02-27 11:59:37	nadir	(/somthing/\1)
2011-02-27 11:59:40	nadir	like that?
2011-02-27 11:59:47	nadir	not exactly, i mean: like.
2011-02-27 11:59:49	huggy-bear	yes, back references were confusing. I can explain
2011-02-27 11:59:50	fsmithred	while and foreach together
2011-02-27 12:00:18	fsmithred	and he had the nerve to say that the big lesson was that it's case-sensitive
2011-02-27 12:00:32	fsmithred	no shit, it's case sensitive
2011-02-27 12:00:34	fsmithred	it's linux
2011-02-27 12:01:28	huggy-bear	back references just refer back to the number of regex you provided already
2011-02-27 12:01:32	huggy-bear	it's actually quite easy
2011-02-27 12:01:37	@telemachus	Ok, I'm here, but brb
2011-02-27 12:01:39	@telemachus	need water
2011-02-27 12:01:45	@telemachus	Then we can get started
2011-02-27 12:01:59	huggy-bear	fsmithred: well, perl is also available for Windows, so it was actually good that he mentioned case sensitivity
2011-02-27 12:02:07	huggy-bear	telemachus: hola!
2011-02-27 12:02:32	fsmithred	hi telemachus

2011-02-27 12:07:23	nadir	?
2011-02-27 12:07:30	fsmithred	I did my homework this time
2011-02-27 12:07:40	@telemachus	fsmithred: Awesome
2011-02-27 12:07:43	@telemachus	nadir: ?
2011-02-27 12:07:44	huggy-bear	so did I, but not all
2011-02-27 12:08:17	fsmithred	oh, it was while and if together
2011-02-27 12:08:24	@telemachus	Ok, how did people find the material this chapter?
2011-02-27 12:08:33	fsmithred	I got question on the last one
2011-02-27 12:08:39	huggy-bear	it was easy compared to the other chapters
2011-02-27 12:08:53	huggy-bear	but back references were explained rather oddly
2011-02-27 12:08:55	fsmithred	well, he doesn't explain how to use while and if together until the next chapter
2011-02-27 12:09:00	huggy-bear	even though it's actually easy
2011-02-27 12:09:05	fsmithred	and all the exercises depend on it
2011-02-27 12:09:17	fsmithred	and what huggy said
2011-02-27 12:09:18	huggy-bear	fsmithred: isn't it just nested?
2011-02-27 12:09:38	fsmithred	yeah, but if you don't know the proper syntax, you're lost
2011-02-27 12:09:58	fsmithred	{{ }} as opposed to {} {}
2011-02-27 12:10:06	@telemachus	huh?
2011-02-27 12:10:11	@telemachus	how could it be {} {}
2011-02-27 12:10:27	fsmithred	that's the way if-else is done
2011-02-27 12:10:28	huggy-bear	yeah, that isn't nested
2011-02-27 12:10:46	huggy-bear	fsmithred: but else isn't a sub-command of if
2011-02-27 12:10:55	fsmithred	huh?
2011-02-27 12:11:07	huggy-bear	it's equal to if
2011-02-27 12:11:09	huggy-bear	right?
2011-02-27 12:11:15	huggy-bear	it's either or
2011-02-27 12:11:28	huggy-bear	whereas in the exercise, if is a subset of the while loop
2011-02-27 12:11:46	@telemachus	fsmithred: As huggy-bear is saying if ... else ... the two ... items are parallel
2011-02-27 12:11:49	fsmithred	ok, that makes sense
2011-02-27 12:11:51	@telemachus	so {} {} makes sense
2011-02-27 12:12:13	@telemachus	but while ... { if ... }  that if stuff is *inside* the while stuff
2011-02-27 12:12:47	huggy-bear	wow, the stars make words *bold* in irssi?
2011-02-27 12:12:53	huggy-bear	sorry to digress... :)
2011-02-27 12:13:04	fsmithred	damn, they're just stars in xchat
2011-02-27 12:14:11	@telemachus	yes
2011-02-27 12:14:16	@telemachus	also _this_ should work in irssi
2011-02-27 12:14:20	@telemachus	for underlining
2011-02-27 12:14:41	@telemachus	meh, under-ripe banana
2011-02-27 12:15:13	@telemachus	ok, so other than if/while foo, most was good?
2011-02-27 12:15:20	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-27 12:15:24	huggy-bear	yep
2011-02-27 12:15:28	fsmithred	perl regexes are way cool
2011-02-27 12:15:28	@telemachus	ok
2011-02-27 12:15:32	@telemachus	fsmithred: Yes
2011-02-27 12:15:39	@telemachus	and you haven't seen the half of it yet, lol
2011-02-27 12:15:40	huggy-bear	yes, they are like superpowers
2011-02-27 12:15:50	fsmithred	but I definitely need help with back references
2011-02-27 12:15:51	@telemachus	can we take a look at page 111?
2011-02-27 12:16:03	fsmithred	already on that page
2011-02-27 12:16:04	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-27 12:16:04	@telemachus	I want to see if people actually got something - the book went very fast here
2011-02-27 12:16:08	@telemachus	good
2011-02-27 12:16:10	@telemachus	I have a gist up
2011-02-27 12:16:22	fsmithred	I have to coffee-up
2011-02-27 12:16:26	@telemachus	but before we run it, can anyone predict what's actually stored in \1, \2, and \3?
2011-02-27 12:16:30	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 12:16:59	huggy-bear	I can
2011-02-27 12:17:08	huggy-bear	these are back references
2011-02-27 12:17:21	@telemachus	mk
2011-02-27 12:17:28	@telemachus	but what do they have in this case?
2011-02-27 12:17:36	@telemachus	i.e., what's actually captured
2011-02-27 12:17:45	huggy-bear	if you said /(.)(*)\1\2/, then 1 = . 2 = *
2011-02-27 12:18:37	huggy-bear	or if u mean the example on pp111, it's probably yabba in the end
2011-02-27 12:18:58	@telemachus	huggy-bear: I mean
2011-02-27 12:19:00	@telemachus	what's \1
2011-02-27 12:19:03	@telemachus	what's \2
2011-02-27 12:19:05	@telemachus	what's \3
2011-02-27 12:19:11	@telemachus	Each has a different capture
2011-02-27 12:19:14	@telemachus	what's in each one
2011-02-27 12:19:16	huggy-bear	back references to already declared regex
2011-02-27 12:19:18	@telemachus	after that line runs
2011-02-27 12:19:23	@telemachus	nope
2011-02-27 12:19:29	@telemachus	they have *captures*
2011-02-27 12:19:30	huggy-bear	:O
2011-02-27 12:19:35	@telemachus	that is pieces of the string that matched
2011-02-27 12:19:47	@telemachus	wait, let me give you an easier one, ok?
2011-02-27 12:19:51	@telemachus	I'll make an example
2011-02-27 12:19:52	fsmithred	didn't huggy already answer that?
2011-02-27 12:20:10	fsmithred	oh
2011-02-27 12:20:18	@telemachus	no, he didn't really
2011-02-27 12:20:19	fsmithred	\1 is a, \2 is b
2011-02-27 12:20:23	@telemachus	or I'm asking badly
2011-02-27 12:20:29	@telemachus	ah, there we go
2011-02-27 12:20:38	@telemachus	what's \3
2011-02-27 12:20:47	fsmithred	and it changes, depending on what string is being tested
2011-02-27 12:20:51	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 12:20:52	huggy-bear	\3 = undef? lol
2011-02-27 12:20:54	fsmithred	there is no \3
2011-02-27 12:20:56	@telemachus	and depending on what matched
2011-02-27 12:20:59	@telemachus	there *is* a 3
2011-02-27 12:21:01	@telemachus	and it matters
2011-02-27 12:21:01	fsmithred	oh. scroll down
2011-02-27 12:21:09	huggy-bear	huh?
2011-02-27 12:21:17	huggy-bear	how can there be a 3 if it's not declared?
2011-02-27 12:21:23	fsmithred	scroll down
2011-02-27 12:21:41	fsmithred	\2 is a
2011-02-27 12:21:52	fsmithred	\3 is b
2011-02-27 12:22:02	fsmithred	\1 is abba
2011-02-27 12:22:22	fsmithred	count parens from the left
2011-02-27 12:22:25	huggy-bear	aaaaaaaah, ok. in this case it seems that 1 is the first opened parentheses, so \1 is both ..
2011-02-27 12:22:31	fsmithred	(not counting the one before the y)
2011-02-27 12:22:50	huggy-bear	or no
2011-02-27 12:22:54	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846331

2011-02-27 12:26:05	nadir	too late for the shorter version
2011-02-27 12:26:07	huggy-bear	 telemachus: can we then summarise that \1 -> first declared regex?, or first declared group of regex in () in this case?
2011-02-27 12:26:18	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-27 12:26:45	@telemachus	sorry nadir and fsmithred
2011-02-27 12:26:46	huggy-bear	So, I got it, and was just confused by all the grouping.
2011-02-27 12:26:47	@telemachus	my bad
2011-02-27 12:27:03	@telemachus	huggy-bear: You're making one big mistake (I think)
2011-02-27 12:27:11	@telemachus	You keep describing \1 as a regex
2011-02-27 12:27:12	@telemachus	it's not
2011-02-27 12:27:15	@telemachus	it's a capture
2011-02-27 12:27:18	huggy-bear	ok
2011-02-27 12:27:24	@telemachus	what is inside / / is a regex
2011-02-27 12:27:33	huggy-bear	I think I do think about capture, not regex
2011-02-27 12:27:34	@telemachus	like /./
2011-02-27 12:27:41	@telemachus	that's a regex
2011-02-27 12:27:42	huggy-bear	ok, regex is all of it. got it. tnx
2011-02-27 12:27:57	@telemachus	but if we have parens to get captures
2011-02-27 12:28:08	@telemachus	like /(a).*(b)/
2011-02-27 12:28:16	@telemachus	then \1 would be 'a' (if found)
2011-02-27 12:28:21	@telemachus	and \2 would be 'b' if found
2011-02-27 12:28:26	@telemachus	what gets captured are strings
2011-02-27 12:28:33	@telemachus	if they match the right place in a regex
2011-02-27 12:28:41	huggy-bear	oh, that makes it complicated
2011-02-27 12:30:07	huggy-bear	telemachus: would you then suggest to group every piece we want to retain as a capture?
2011-02-27 12:31:13	@telemachus	yes
2011-02-27 12:31:18	@telemachus	you have to group to get a capture
2011-02-27 12:31:23	huggy-bear	ah, ok
2011-02-27 12:31:34	@telemachus	though sometimes you want a group and don't care about captures
2011-02-27 12:31:41	@telemachus	in which case, there are "non-capturing groups"
2011-02-27 12:31:45	@telemachus	but that's getting ahead
2011-02-27 12:32:10	 *	huggy-bear is afraid...
2011-02-27 12:33:05	@telemachus	yeah yeah
2011-02-27 12:33:07	@telemachus	anyhow
2011-02-27 12:33:15	@telemachus	does that triple capture make sense now?
2011-02-27 12:33:27	huggy-bear	telemachus: but \g{1} is better, right?
2011-02-27 12:33:31	@telemachus	((.)(.)) -> not boobies
2011-02-27 12:33:33	huggy-bear	it does now
2011-02-27 12:33:37	@telemachus	\1 is .
2011-02-27 12:33:39	huggy-bear	hahaha
2011-02-27 12:33:42	@telemachus	\2 is the next .
2011-02-27 12:33:45	@telemachus	\3 is ..
2011-02-27 12:33:58	@telemachus	that is, whatever actual chars get captured
2011-02-27 12:34:00	nadir	no
2011-02-27 12:34:02	huggy-bear	\3 is both boobs
2011-02-27 12:34:32	nadir	 -> /3 is .. and both again, or not?
2011-02-27 12:34:47	nadir	because inside of /3 is \1  \2
2011-02-27 12:34:57	fsmithred	don't you count from the left?
2011-02-27 12:35:12	nadir	which means . . then the first dot again, then the second dot again.
2011-02-27 12:35:15	fsmithred	\1 is ..?
2011-02-27 12:35:26	@telemachus	fsmithred: You are right, I typed tooooooo quickly
2011-02-27 12:35:26	nadir	(.) -> \1 is .
2011-02-27 12:35:27	@telemachus	duh
2011-02-27 12:35:31	@telemachus	yeah, no
2011-02-27 12:35:35	nadir	(.) -> \2 is dot.
2011-02-27 12:35:39	@telemachus	\1 is ..
2011-02-27 12:35:43	@telemachus	\2 is the first .
2011-02-27 12:35:50	@telemachus	\3 is the second .
2011-02-27 12:35:56	@telemachus	fsmithred is right, I typed too fast
2011-02-27 12:36:48	@telemachus	ok, now that I've messed everyone up
2011-02-27 12:36:50	@telemachus	next topic?
2011-02-27 12:36:55	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 12:36:56	@telemachus	or do we want to do that a sec more?
2011-02-27 12:37:00	huggy-bear	no, you actually clarified it
2011-02-27 12:37:10	nadir	no.
2011-02-27 12:37:34	@telemachus	nadir: no to which?
2011-02-27 12:37:36	nadir	if i got it like this ( (d) (d) \1)
2011-02-27 12:37:39	@telemachus	was a multiple choice question
2011-02-27 12:37:40	@telemachus	lol
2011-02-27 12:37:43	nadir	-> \1
2011-02-27 12:37:51	nadir	it is the most outer paren?
2011-02-27 12:38:04	nadir	or the first one which _also_ gets closed again?
2011-02-27 12:38:13	huggy-bear	good question
2011-02-27 12:38:23	nadir	(/y((.)(.)\3\2) d\1/)
2011-02-27 12:38:23	@telemachus	nadir: \1 is whatever is first
2011-02-27 12:38:29	@telemachus	start with a paren on the left
2011-02-27 12:38:35	nadir	yes, first ok. But from what point of view.
2011-02-27 12:38:38	@telemachus	whatever is in *that* is \1 - when it closes
2011-02-27 12:38:52	nadir	the first which closes is (.)
2011-02-27 12:38:56	fsmithred	make sure you're only counting parens inside / /
2011-02-27 12:38:59	huggy-bear	telemachus: so, even though \1 is inside the first (, it's still the first (?
2011-02-27 12:39:00	nadir	the first at all is the one around all of it.
2011-02-27 12:39:05	@telemachus	nadir: Right, but that's not what I said
2011-02-27 12:39:09	@telemachus	I said, start with first paren
2011-02-27 12:39:12	@telemachus	when *it* closes
2011-02-27 12:39:14	@telemachus	it's 1
2011-02-27 12:39:28	@telemachus	so in taht case \1 is ((.)(.)\3\2)
2011-02-27 12:39:31	@telemachus	all of that is \1
2011-02-27 12:39:37	huggy-bear	ah ok
2011-02-27 12:39:43	@telemachus	cause the first paren closes right after 2
2011-02-27 12:39:56	nadir	are you sure?
2011-02-27 12:40:03	nadir	(/y((.)(.)\3\2) d\1/)
2011-02-27 12:40:05	nadir	yabba
2011-02-27 12:40:05	fsmithred	yes, he's sure
2011-02-27 12:40:50	@telemachus	nadir: Run the gist again
2011-02-27 12:40:58	@telemachus	curl -L http://xrl.us/bij79g | perl -
2011-02-27 12:41:03	@telemachus	$1 is 'abba'
2011-02-27 12:41:10	@telemachus	which is (.)(.)\3\2
2011-02-27 12:41:18	@telemachus	which is what is inside the first capture group
2011-02-27 12:41:36	@telemachus	fsmithred: Actually, at this point, I'm less and less sure
2011-02-27 12:41:38	@telemachus	but I think so
2011-02-27 12:41:39	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-27 12:41:54	@telemachus	I'm sorry, I seem to have confused us all
2011-02-27 12:41:57	@telemachus	I had good intentions
2011-02-27 12:43:00	huggy-bear	telemachus: I just tried something
2011-02-27 12:43:16	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 12:43:20	@telemachus	nadir: You ok?
2011-02-27 12:43:27	@telemachus	huggy-bear: what did you did?
2011-02-27 12:43:28	nadir	yup. got it now
2011-02-27 12:43:33	@telemachus	cool
2011-02-27 12:43:41	nadir	the double bb does not make it more easy.
2011-02-27 12:43:46	huggy-bear	I tried whether it would work to put \1 inside the first (), and it doesn't
2011-02-27 12:43:50	nadir	you need to wrap the head twice.
2011-02-27 12:43:52	@telemachus	in one sense, it's simple, but yea double boobs is distracting
2011-02-27 12:43:52	huggy-bear	but no error back
2011-02-27 12:44:04	@telemachus	huh?
2011-02-27 12:44:06	huggy-bear	haha! so how come I don't get it then :D
2011-02-27 12:44:19	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Can you show me what you mean?
2011-02-27 12:44:24	huggy-bear	sec, will put it in a pastebin
2011-02-27 12:44:27	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 12:44:54	huggy-bear	http://paste.debian.net/109021/
2011-02-27 12:45:21	huggy-bear	(that makes no sense, but just wanted to try it out)
2011-02-27 12:45:29	huggy-bear	no output
2011-02-27 12:45:39	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 12:45:41	@telemachus	that's borken
2011-02-27 12:45:47	@telemachus	can you see what you're asking perl to do
2011-02-27 12:45:49	@telemachus	?
2011-02-27 12:45:52	@telemachus	what's \1?
2011-02-27 12:45:58	huggy-bear	yes, haha. it makes no sense
2011-02-27 12:46:04	huggy-bear	i was just curious
2011-02-27 12:46:05	@telemachus	hint: you're asking perl to find x inside itself
2011-02-27 12:46:13	@telemachus	well, it's not an error
2011-02-27 12:46:17	@telemachus	it's just a failed match
2011-02-27 12:46:24	@telemachus	regexes rarely have real "errors"
2011-02-27 12:46:30	huggy-bear	perl != philosophy
2011-02-27 12:46:32	nadir	trying that for 40 years finding x inside itself
2011-02-27 12:46:34	@telemachus	they usually just "don't match" when you build em wrong
2011-02-27 12:46:47	@telemachus	nadir: this is no ding-an-sich
2011-02-27 12:46:51	huggy-bear	telemachus: that makes it more diff to debug then
2011-02-27 12:47:02	huggy-bear	difficult
2011-02-27 12:47:13	huggy-bear	ding-an-sich, right! haha
2011-02-27 12:47:15	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Yes
2011-02-27 12:47:23	@telemachus	you are true
2011-02-27 12:47:26	nadir	an-sich or für-sich? or an-sich-und-für-sich.
2011-02-27 12:47:32	@telemachus	as an old italian professor of mine used to say
2011-02-27 12:47:35	 *	nadir runs
2011-02-27 12:47:41	@telemachus	He taught me latin but was Italian
2011-02-27 12:47:49	@telemachus	and spoke interesting English
2011-02-27 12:47:57	@telemachus	like "You are true" => "Correct"
2011-02-27 12:48:17	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 12:48:50	@telemachus	anyhow
2011-02-27 12:48:51	@telemachus	ok
2011-02-27 12:48:57	@telemachus	should we look at exercises?
2011-02-27 12:49:04	@telemachus	or did people have more questions on the chapter itself?
2011-02-27 12:49:11	huggy-bear	I'm fine
2011-02-27 12:49:15	fsmithred	ex
2011-02-27 12:49:59	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 12:50:46	@telemachus	Anyone want to show 1?
2011-02-27 12:50:51	huggy-bear	http://paste.debian.net/109022/
2011-02-27 12:51:30	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Looks good. Though in that case, no reason to chomp
2011-02-27 12:51:45	huggy-bear	yeah, i forgot to delete that
2011-02-27 12:51:54	fsmithred	spoiler - all the exercises are in one script
2011-02-27 12:51:56	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/846339
2011-02-27 12:52:01	huggy-bear	initially, I had a different print command where a new line would be created, so
2011-02-27 12:52:17	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-02-27 12:52:26	@telemachus	I'm guessing everyone was ok there?
2011-02-27 12:52:32	@telemachus	the regex itself is dead simple
2011-02-27 12:52:39	huggy-bear	telemachus: yeah, you already played with the regex
2011-02-27 12:53:09	huggy-bear	yours looks neater
2011-02-27 12:53:18	@telemachus	how do you mean?
2011-02-27 12:53:24	huggy-bear	neater than mine
2011-02-27 12:53:35	huggy-bear	for ex 2, i did this: /(F|f)(R|r)(E|e)(D|d)/
2011-02-27 12:54:03	 *	fsmithred is re-reading the exercise
2011-02-27 12:54:27	@telemachus	woah, nelly
2011-02-27 12:54:28	huggy-bear	BUT, if my name was fRed, then mine would be better! :P
2011-02-27 12:54:38	fsmithred	only needed the F in upper case
2011-02-27 12:54:43	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-27 12:54:50	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 12:54:54	@telemachus	/[Ff]red/
2011-02-27 12:54:55	@telemachus	I think
2011-02-27 12:54:59	huggy-bear	fsmithred: what if there's an alien called fReD?
2011-02-27 12:55:06	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Then he's fucked
2011-02-27 12:55:07	fsmithred	or a troll
2011-02-27 12:55:11	huggy-bear	hahaha
2011-02-27 12:55:20	nadir	the alien, or fsmith?
2011-02-27 12:55:45	fsmithred	is it a girl alien?
2011-02-27 12:56:20	nadir	f the RED haired.
2011-02-27 12:56:22	 *	telemachus sighs
2011-02-27 12:56:26	huggy-bear	hahaha
2011-02-27 12:56:29	@telemachus	I teach at an all-girls school
2011-02-27 12:56:32	@telemachus	I think I'm glad now
2011-02-27 12:56:36	nadir	WHAT?
2011-02-27 12:56:37	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-27 12:56:40	@telemachus	less alien fucking boobie jokes
2011-02-27 12:56:42	fsmithred	damn
2011-02-27 12:56:48	nadir	you ... oh... ahh... uhhhh
2011-02-27 12:56:50	@telemachus	you all didn't know that?
2011-02-27 12:56:50	fsmithred	need a guest lecturer?
2011-02-27 12:56:54	 *	telemachus laughs
2011-02-27 12:56:56	@telemachus	sighs
2011-02-27 12:56:58	huggy-bear	nope
2011-02-27 12:57:07	huggy-bear	telemachus: what do you teach? IT related?
2011-02-27 12:57:11	@telemachus	ok, one more thing to make it even more Britney: Catholic all girls school
2011-02-27 12:57:18	nadir	oh my god.
2011-02-27 12:57:20	@telemachus	huggy-bear: I do now, yes
2011-02-27 12:57:21	nadir	I go nut.
2011-02-27 12:57:27	@telemachus	nadir: settle down, boy
2011-02-27 12:57:30	 *	fsmithred is starting to sweat
2011-02-27 12:57:36	nadir	no. that is too much for me.
2011-02-27 12:57:45	huggy-bear	telemachus: you basically work in what is nadir's wet dream :)
2011-02-27 12:57:51	huggy-bear	and fsmithred's
2011-02-27 12:58:06	nadir	telemachus, you sell videos?
2011-02-27 12:58:10	fsmithred	lol
2011-02-27 12:58:11	@telemachus	sighs
2011-02-27 12:58:14	@telemachus	all right boys
2011-02-27 12:58:16	@telemachus	back to business
2011-02-27 12:58:22	nadir	(/[\S\d](.)\g{-1}/)
2011-02-27 12:58:26	nadir	what does that mean?
2011-02-27 12:58:33	fsmithred	fuck if I know
2011-02-27 12:58:37	nadir	(damn am i good at switchign subjects)
2011-02-27 12:58:42	@telemachus	(yup)
2011-02-27 12:58:45	@telemachus	Ok, we can analyze that
2011-02-27 12:58:49	@telemachus	match:
2011-02-27 12:58:55	huggy-bear	SPACE. \d was 0-9
2011-02-27 12:58:57	@telemachus	non-space or a digit
2011-02-27 12:58:58	fsmithred	\S non-whitespace
2011-02-27 12:59:01	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 12:59:12	@telemachus	first we need "not a space" or a digit
2011-02-27 12:59:12	fsmithred	what was the question?
2011-02-27 12:59:13	huggy-bear	ah yeah, capital s, sorry
2011-02-27 12:59:17	@telemachus	then any char but a newline
2011-02-27 12:59:21	@telemachus	then that same char again
2011-02-27 12:59:23	@telemachus	done
2011-02-27 12:59:24	nadir	and inside the [] means either or?
2011-02-27 12:59:37	@telemachus	nadir yes-ish
2011-02-27 12:59:44	@telemachus	it means "anything from this class"
2011-02-27 12:59:44	huggy-bear	in [] you can make a range of chars
2011-02-27 12:59:51	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 12:59:52	nadir	good enough for a nadir.
2011-02-27 13:00:01	huggy-bear	[0-9] is the same as \d
2011-02-27 13:00:05	@telemachus	[^\d] is good to note too
2011-02-27 13:00:13	@telemachus	if ^ is the first thing in there
2011-02-27 13:00:19	@telemachus	it negates the character class
2011-02-27 13:00:22	huggy-bear	yeah
2011-02-27 13:00:22	nadir	and \g{number} is new, but better?
2011-02-27 13:00:26	fsmithred	ok, I got a question about that one
2011-02-27 13:00:31	@telemachus	actually huggy-bear now that we use unicode, \d is NOT 1-9
2011-02-27 13:00:36	@telemachus	the book says it is, but they LIE
2011-02-27 13:00:39	@telemachus	one sec
2011-02-27 13:00:42	fsmithred	it'll match a word that has three of the same non-whitespace charagcters
2011-02-27 13:00:44	huggy-bear	boah
2011-02-27 13:00:58	huggy-bear	I <3 unicode
2011-02-27 13:01:38	fsmithred	nadir, the {-1} means you count backward from where you are
2011-02-27 13:01:42	fsmithred	relative measure
2011-02-27 13:01:56	fsmithred	so, count back to (.)
2011-02-27 13:01:56	nadir	well: but count what?
2011-02-27 13:02:02	fsmithred	captures
2011-02-27 13:02:11	nadir	to a ... ah, capture.
2011-02-27 13:02:25	nadir	I only get to the point where it says it is better.
2011-02-27 13:02:33	nadir	s/get/got
2011-02-27 13:02:56	fsmithred	so, I tried to figure out how to get it to only print words with exactly two matching characters
2011-02-27 13:03:07	fsmithred	this one will print ...
2011-02-27 13:03:14	fsmithred	how to exclude that?
2011-02-27 13:03:46	fsmithred	or will the answer make me crazy?
2011-02-27 13:04:00	nadir	[^patter], yes or o?
2011-02-27 13:04:07	@telemachus	http://xrl.us/bij8bi
2011-02-27 13:04:08	nadir	damn, yes or no.
2011-02-27 13:04:20	@telemachus	see the comment on the accepted answer by chas.owen - his comment
2011-02-27 13:04:21	fsmithred	yeah, that would probably work
2011-02-27 13:06:09	huggy-bear	aaaaaah
2011-02-27 13:06:15	@telemachus	?
2011-02-27 13:06:16	@telemachus	huh
2011-02-27 13:07:02	huggy-bear	so, \d is all digits, Arabic, Kanji, ...
2011-02-27 13:07:32	huggy-bear	cool
2011-02-27 13:08:39	@telemachus	huggy-bear: less cool in some cases, but yeah
2011-02-27 13:08:41	huggy-bear	so, it would know that 二十一 is a number, not a string
2011-02-27 13:08:46	@telemachus	that is, you get false positives
2011-02-27 13:08:56	huggy-bear	yeah, i guess it depends
2011-02-27 13:09:01	@telemachus	but in general, we're mostly *still* working with ascii
2011-02-27 13:09:03	@telemachus	who are we kidding
2011-02-27 13:09:19	@telemachus	ascii or some extended european thing with accents
2011-02-27 13:09:20	huggy-bear	yeah
2011-02-27 13:09:24	@telemachus	anyhow
2011-02-27 13:09:29	@telemachus	someone want to do number 2?
2011-02-27 13:09:39	fsmithred	escape the dot
2011-02-27 13:09:50	huggy-bear	same as no1, but with this: /\./
2011-02-27 13:10:05	huggy-bear	yeah, fsmithred was quicker :)
2011-02-27 13:10:20	@telemachus	bingo
2011-02-27 13:10:22	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 13:10:23	@telemachus	3?
2011-02-27 13:10:26	huggy-bear	looks so metal
2011-02-27 13:10:34	fsmithred	been waiting for a couple minutes to say that
2011-02-27 13:10:41	huggy-bear	actually, that _was_ no 3 :D haha
2011-02-27 13:10:45	@telemachus	shh
2011-02-27 13:10:47	@telemachus	4?
2011-02-27 13:10:50	 *	telemachus laughs
2011-02-27 13:10:54	@telemachus	I lost track of numbers
2011-02-27 13:11:01	@telemachus	since we did 1+2 together really
2011-02-27 13:11:01	huggy-bear	/[A-Z][a-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:11:20	fsmithred	hm
2011-02-27 13:11:25	fsmithred	I used a star
2011-02-27 13:11:30	nadir	+ means at minimum one?
2011-02-27 13:11:31	@telemachus	fsmithred: where?
2011-02-27 13:11:43	huggy-bear	fsmithred: * means also 0 or more
2011-02-27 13:11:48	huggy-bear	+ means 1 or more
2011-02-27 13:12:12	@telemachus	huggy-bear: would yours match 'freD'? Should it? Their instructions are vague...
2011-02-27 13:12:30	huggy-bear	telemachus: lemme check
2011-02-27 13:12:31	fsmithred	oh, I was thinking that A is a word, but I guess it's all caps
2011-02-27 13:12:41	@telemachus	I guess 'capitalized' means 'first'
2011-02-27 13:12:46	@telemachus	so I take that back
2011-02-27 13:12:51	huggy-bear	mine is matching at least FrEd
2011-02-27 13:12:58	@telemachus	Ah, but here's one 'OBrian'
2011-02-27 13:12:59	huggy-bear	(from a text file)
2011-02-27 13:13:02	@telemachus	no match
2011-02-27 13:13:13	huggy-bear	yeah, especially O'Brian
2011-02-27 13:13:25	@telemachus	so maybe /[A-Z]+[a-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:13:26	@telemachus	?
2011-02-27 13:13:36	huggy-bear	hmm, better
2011-02-27 13:13:38	@telemachus	Silly example really, but just playing
2011-02-27 13:13:47	huggy-bear	but what about ' in names?
2011-02-27 13:13:50	huggy-bear	O'Brian?
2011-02-27 13:13:53	@telemachus	and neither gets O'Brian
2011-02-27 13:13:58	@telemachus	yeah, was saying
2011-02-27 13:14:08	huggy-bear	[A-Z]+\'[a-z]+
2011-02-27 13:14:19	huggy-bear	no
2011-02-27 13:15:04	huggy-bear	hmm, how would I make \' optional?
2011-02-27 13:15:06	fsmithred	wouldn't you need a separate pattern for O'Brien?
2011-02-27 13:15:12	huggy-bear	yeah i got it
2011-02-27 13:15:13	@telemachus	'?
2011-02-27 13:15:29	@telemachus	and ' doesn't need to be escaped, does it?
2011-02-27 13:15:30	fsmithred	yeah, but then you'll get FRed
2011-02-27 13:15:30	huggy-bear	/[A-Z]+\'[a-z]+|[A-Z]+[a-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:15:32	huggy-bear	that should work
2011-02-27 13:15:38	@telemachus	fsmithred: Right
2011-02-27 13:15:39	huggy-bear	oh yeah
2011-02-27 13:15:41	huggy-bear	sorry
2011-02-27 13:15:41	@telemachus	That's the problem
2011-02-27 13:15:43	@telemachus	which is ok
2011-02-27 13:15:49	@telemachus	regexes aren't intelligent
2011-02-27 13:15:50	huggy-bear	/[A-Z]+'[a-z]+|[A-Z]+[a-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:15:52	huggy-bear	like that?
2011-02-27 13:15:54	@telemachus	they can't catch spelling errors
2011-02-27 13:15:59	fsmithred	two patterns separated by |
2011-02-27 13:16:05	@telemachus	huggy-bear: No, that demands a '
2011-02-27 13:16:13	huggy-bear	telemachus: but it has one
2011-02-27 13:16:32	huggy-bear	just not escaped this time
2011-02-27 13:16:33	@telemachus	one sec
2011-02-27 13:16:46	huggy-bear	8th character from left
2011-02-27 13:17:54	fsmithred	this: /(^[A-Z][\sa-z]*|^[A-Z]\'[A-Z][\sa-z]*)/
2011-02-27 13:18:00	fsmithred	I think I got it right
2011-02-27 13:18:33	huggy-bear	whitesspace and a-z?
2011-02-27 13:18:36	huggy-bear	why whitespace?
2011-02-27 13:19:06	fsmithred	um
2011-02-27 13:19:12	nadir	\S
2011-02-27 13:19:15	fsmithred	I just copied it from my homework and edited
2011-02-27 13:19:34	huggy-bear	so, in case someone is called O Brien?
2011-02-27 13:19:35	fsmithred	can't remember why I put that htere, but I think you're right that it doesn't belong
2011-02-27 13:19:47	huggy-bear	or wait, you have a ^
2011-02-27 13:19:59	fsmithred	starts with upper case
2011-02-27 13:20:22	huggy-bear	but doesn't ^[A-Z] mean starting with *anything but* uppercase?
2011-02-27 13:20:26	@telemachus	I say we shoot all the O'Brians and be done with it
2011-02-27 13:20:31	@telemachus	huggy-bear: no
2011-02-27 13:20:36	nadir	huh?
2011-02-27 13:20:39	@telemachus	^ negates *inside* the []
2011-02-27 13:20:43	nadir	Why does that not work:
2011-02-27 13:20:44	fsmithred	oh, I included it for single letter words
2011-02-27 13:20:47	huggy-bear	telemachus: half of Ireland and a third of the Chesapeake? :D
2011-02-27 13:20:47	@telemachus	outside it means "anchor to start of line"
2011-02-27 13:20:52	nadir	if (/[A-Z] | [A-Z]\'[A-Z]/ ) { print "match\n" }
2011-02-27 13:20:59	 *	telemachus shrugs
2011-02-27 13:21:01	@telemachus	fuck em
2011-02-27 13:21:07	huggy-bear	hahaha
2011-02-27 13:21:25	huggy-bear	and what if I want to parse my Star Trek episode guides?
2011-02-27 13:21:33	huggy-bear	there are people called T'Pau
2011-02-27 13:21:35	huggy-bear	and such
2011-02-27 13:21:39	huggy-bear	:D
2011-02-27 13:21:40	@telemachus	fuck them two times
2011-02-27 13:21:44	@telemachus	star trek
2011-02-27 13:21:44	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 13:21:46	@telemachus	phooey
2011-02-27 13:21:53	@telemachus	ok, wait, something cool to show people
2011-02-27 13:22:34	fsmithred	so...
2011-02-27 13:22:41	fsmithred	no more Irish Catholic girls?
2011-02-27 13:22:45	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 13:22:49	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846387
2011-02-27 13:23:20	@telemachus	and it's output, https://gist.github.com/846389
2011-02-27 13:23:36	huggy-bear	telemachus: i just did something similar a few lines ago
2011-02-27 13:23:46	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Yes, I know ;)
2011-02-27 13:23:47	huggy-bear	/[A-Z]+'[a-z]+|[A-Z]+[a-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:23:57	huggy-bear	what's qr?
2011-02-27 13:24:01	@telemachus	I'm using your regex as an example of YAPE::Regex::Explain
2011-02-27 13:24:10	@telemachus	qr => quote as a regex
2011-02-27 13:24:16	@telemachus	it's how you save a regex into a variable
2011-02-27 13:24:24	huggy-bear	ah, cool
2011-02-27 13:24:59	@telemachus	http://search.cpan.org/~gsullivan/YAPE-Regex-Explain-4.01/Explain.pm
2011-02-27 13:25:12	@telemachus	It's a tool that turns regular expressions into verbal explanations
2011-02-27 13:25:13	@telemachus	quite cool
2011-02-27 13:25:19	huggy-bear	wow
2011-02-27 13:25:47	nadir	$_ = "O'Brien" -> (/[A-Z]/) does match
2011-02-27 13:26:08	huggy-bear	nadir: yeah? cool
2011-02-27 13:26:11	nadir	(/[A-Z] | [a-z]/) does not match. Why?
2011-02-27 13:26:26	huggy-bear	nadir: doesn't it ignore ' ?
2011-02-27 13:26:46	nadir	the question is why the second does not match.
2011-02-27 13:27:00	fsmithred	no clue here
2011-02-27 13:27:28	huggy-bear	nadir: /[A-Z] | [a-z]/ means: 1 character, either a capitalised letter, or a small one
2011-02-27 13:27:38	nadir	yes.
2011-02-27 13:27:40	nadir	and?
2011-02-27 13:27:47	nadir	why does it not match?
2011-02-27 13:27:56	fsmithred	yeah, but every word contains lots of one character
2011-02-27 13:28:08	huggy-bear	yeah
2011-02-27 13:28:10	huggy-bear	hmm
2011-02-27 13:28:21	fsmithred	I would expect that to match
2011-02-27 13:28:23	huggy-bear	but not only 1 character
2011-02-27 13:28:28	huggy-bear	O'Brian is many characters
2011-02-27 13:28:40	huggy-bear	so [A-Z]+[a-z] is better
2011-02-27 13:28:50	huggy-bear	sorry, [A-Z]+[a-z]+
2011-02-27 13:28:50	@telemachus	nadir: No space
2011-02-27 13:28:52	fsmithred	what limits the hits to only one character?
2011-02-27 13:28:55	@telemachus	your regex has spaces
2011-02-27 13:29:00	nadir	ok
2011-02-27 13:29:02	nadir	thanks
2011-02-27 13:29:12	fsmithred	aha
2011-02-27 13:29:23	fsmithred	have to remember read the white space
2011-02-27 13:29:26	nadir	holy jesus.
2011-02-27 13:29:33	huggy-bear	wait wait!
2011-02-27 13:29:36	huggy-bear	' is not needed
2011-02-27 13:29:48	huggy-bear	[A-Z]+[a-z] works perfectly
2011-02-27 13:30:04	huggy-bear	i just tested
2011-02-27 13:30:12	huggy-bear	it doesn't ignore O'Brian
2011-02-27 13:30:17	huggy-bear	yaaaaaaaaaay
2011-02-27 13:30:37	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846396
2011-02-27 13:31:01	@telemachus	that sounds wrong
2011-02-27 13:31:10	@telemachus	that should not match---ah, wait
2011-02-27 13:31:14	@telemachus	do you see what's matching?
2011-02-27 13:31:20	@telemachus	Br
2011-02-27 13:31:23	@telemachus	Br matches
2011-02-27 13:31:37	huggy-bear	aaaaaaah
2011-02-27 13:31:38	huggy-bear	ok
2011-02-27 13:31:46	huggy-bear	so, no problem with Irihs surnames
2011-02-27 13:31:47	huggy-bear	neat!
2011-02-27 13:31:54	huggy-bear	or Vulcan names
2011-02-27 13:32:04	nadir	No.
2011-02-27 13:32:11	huggy-bear	nadir: tnx
2011-02-27 13:32:13	nadir	Why does it match? or rather what?
2011-02-27 13:32:28	nadir	Br.
2011-02-27 13:32:29	nadir	ok
2011-02-27 13:32:45	nadir	What about that?:
2011-02-27 13:32:48	nadir	if (/[A-Z]|[A-Z]\'[A-Z]/ ) { print "match\n" }
2011-02-27 13:33:23	@telemachus	nadir: What matches is 'B' for [A-Z]+
2011-02-27 13:33:24	@telemachus	and then
2011-02-27 13:33:31	@telemachus	'r' for [a-z]
2011-02-27 13:33:32	nadir	r
2011-02-27 13:33:33	@telemachus	so it matches
2011-02-27 13:33:41	nadir	yup, got that. thanks.
2011-02-27 13:33:47	@telemachus	ugh
2011-02-27 13:33:56	@telemachus	seriously, let's quit the O'Briens
2011-02-27 13:33:57	@telemachus	lol
2011-02-27 13:34:01	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 13:34:02	huggy-bear	ok
2011-02-27 13:34:14	nadir	first give me a "should work" then we can bomb Ireland.
2011-02-27 13:34:55	huggy-bear	i don't have no 5
2011-02-27 13:35:02	huggy-bear	but don't remember why
2011-02-27 13:35:32	@telemachus	nadir: Should work for what?
2011-02-27 13:35:50	nadir	for irish names. an upper letter, a ' and another upper letter.
2011-02-27 13:36:04	@telemachus	ah, irish names
2011-02-27 13:36:04	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 13:36:06	@telemachus	one sec
2011-02-27 13:36:09	fsmithred	can I use & between two regexes?
2011-02-27 13:36:22	nadir	(/(\s)\1)
2011-02-27 13:36:24	nadir	i hope
2011-02-27 13:36:34	@telemachus	/[A-Z]'?[A-z]+/
2011-02-27 13:36:37	@telemachus	can we go home now?
2011-02-27 13:36:45	nadir	one whitespace character followed by the same whitespace character.
2011-02-27 13:37:08	nadir	for our Irish friends i proposed that:
2011-02-27 13:37:12	nadir	<nadir> if (/[A-Z]|[A-Z]\'[A-Z]/ ) { print "match\n" }
2011-02-27 13:37:20	nadir	that is: for all names.
2011-02-27 13:37:25	huggy-bear	lol, no 5 is basically the /((.)(.)\3\2)/ we talked about.
2011-02-27 13:37:28	nadir	It shall hit all names -> upper letter,
2011-02-27 13:37:39	nadir	but also the irish ones -> upper letter ' uppper letter.
2011-02-27 13:37:56	nadir	(.) is not a whitepsace
2011-02-27 13:38:18	huggy-bear	nadir: correct
2011-02-27 13:38:19	nadir	or not? it is any character followed by any same characer.
2011-02-27 13:38:36	@telemachus	nadir: Your first bit is confusing and I think unnecessary
2011-02-27 13:38:38	huggy-bear	nadir: . is any character except whitespace
2011-02-27 13:38:50	nadir	yes?
2011-02-27 13:38:54	@telemachus	instead of /[A-Z]|[A-Z]\'/
2011-02-27 13:39:03	@telemachus	just /[A-Z]'?/
2011-02-27 13:39:12	huggy-bear	telemachus: what is ? ?
2011-02-27 13:39:16	@telemachus	A-Z and an OPTIONAL '
2011-02-27 13:39:22	@telemachus	? is a quantifier
2011-02-27 13:39:25	huggy-bear	aaaaaaah, cool. tnx
2011-02-27 13:39:30	@telemachus	it means "0 or 1 of the preceding"
2011-02-27 13:39:34	@telemachus	i.e., optional
2011-02-27 13:39:42	@telemachus	* = "0 or more"
2011-02-27 13:39:47	@telemachus	+ = "1 or more"
2011-02-27 13:39:53	@telemachus	? = "0 or 1"
2011-02-27 13:40:13	nadir	i see.
2011-02-27 13:40:25	nadir	[A-Z]'?
2011-02-27 13:40:26	@telemachus	and for the record, * (0 or more) will do shocking things on you some day
2011-02-27 13:40:29	@telemachus	it will fuck you up
2011-02-27 13:40:31	@telemachus	I promise
2011-02-27 13:40:32	nadir	if there is a ', pick it.
2011-02-27 13:40:37	@telemachus	correct
2011-02-27 13:40:44	nadir	good.
2011-02-27 13:40:45	@telemachus	and again, ' doesn't need to be escaped
2011-02-27 13:40:50	@telemachus	It's just an apostrophe
2011-02-27 13:40:51	nadir	enough of Ireland for me.
2011-02-27 13:40:54	@telemachus	not a magic character
2011-02-27 13:40:56	huggy-bear	telemachus: because it also means 0, so it can mean "or without what was just declared"?
2011-02-27 13:41:07	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 13:41:11	nadir	? -> optional
2011-02-27 13:41:12	@telemachus	0 or 1 => optional
2011-02-27 13:41:18	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 13:41:20	nadir	fuck am i good.
2011-02-27 13:41:28	 *	telemachus high fives nadir
2011-02-27 13:41:30	 *	huggy-bear gives nadir a cookie...
2011-02-27 13:41:31	nadir	I really have earned some catolique girls
2011-02-27 13:41:37	@telemachus	dude
2011-02-27 13:41:51	nadir	:-) sorry.
2011-02-27 13:41:57	@telemachus	k, k
2011-02-27 13:43:07	@telemachus	ok, hmm
2011-02-27 13:43:16	huggy-bear	continue?
2011-02-27 13:43:20	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 13:43:21	@telemachus	5?
2011-02-27 13:43:26	@telemachus	or did we do that?
2011-02-27 13:43:46	huggy-bear	I think no 5 is the boob thing, no?
2011-02-27 13:43:52	@telemachus	um
2011-02-27 13:43:55	@telemachus	boobies
2011-02-27 13:43:55	nadir	(/(\s)\1/)
2011-02-27 13:43:55	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 13:43:56	huggy-bear	((.)(.)\2\1) ?
2011-02-27 13:43:58	nadir	is what i say.
2011-02-27 13:44:02	@telemachus	nadir: no
2011-02-27 13:44:10	@telemachus	\s matches space char
2011-02-27 13:44:12	@telemachus	\S?
2011-02-27 13:44:24	fsmithred	non-space
2011-02-27 13:44:26	huggy-bear	\S = negation of space
2011-02-27 13:44:33	@telemachus	/(\S)\1/
2011-02-27 13:44:36	huggy-bear	everything but the 5 space chars in perl
2011-02-27 13:44:37	@telemachus	maybe
2011-02-27 13:44:56	nadir	                               has a two of the same nonwhitespace
2011-02-27 13:44:56	nadir	characters next to each other.
2011-02-27 13:44:57	huggy-bear	telemachus: /(\S)\1/ <--- solution to 5?
2011-02-27 13:44:59	nadir	ups.
2011-02-27 13:45:16	nadir	has a two of the same non- ups... nonwhitespace... sorry.
2011-02-27 13:45:20	@telemachus	huggy-bear: Yup, see my answer above
2011-02-27 13:45:48	huggy-bear	ok
2011-02-27 13:45:59	@telemachus	anyone do 6?
2011-02-27 13:45:59	huggy-bear	so, boobs don't work?
2011-02-27 13:46:04	huggy-bear	me me!
2011-02-27 13:46:13	fsmithred	if (/wilma.*fred|fred.*wilma/)
2011-02-27 13:46:13	huggy-bear	/(wilma|fred)(*)+(wilma|fred)/
2011-02-27 13:46:49	@telemachus	fsmithred: Yes
2011-02-27 13:46:50	@telemachus	huggy-bear: no
2011-02-27 13:46:57	huggy-bear	whyyyyyyyyyy
2011-02-27 13:46:59	@telemachus	yours will match wilma...wilma
2011-02-27 13:47:02	@telemachus	without fred
2011-02-27 13:47:16	huggy-bear	but I said wilma or fred
2011-02-27 13:47:17	@telemachus	I'll be honest, it was my first thought too
2011-02-27 13:47:35	@telemachus	huggy-bear: You said match (1) wilma or fred and then (2) wilma or fred
2011-02-27 13:47:41	@telemachus	so if we have a line wilma loves wilma
2011-02-27 13:47:43	@telemachus	it matches
2011-02-27 13:47:45	@telemachus	with no fred
2011-02-27 13:47:46	huggy-bear	aaaaah
2011-02-27 13:47:46	huggy-bear	ok
2011-02-27 13:47:47	@telemachus	that's bad
2011-02-27 13:47:50	huggy-bear	makes sense
2011-02-27 13:47:52	@telemachus	it tricked me too
2011-02-27 13:47:54	@telemachus	I got it wrong
2011-02-27 13:47:58	@telemachus	exactly as you did
2011-02-27 13:48:12	@telemachus	it's almost a logic puzzle: did you really focus on the requirements, type of thing
2011-02-27 13:48:16	@telemachus	fsmithred: You nailed it
2011-02-27 13:48:33	fsmithred	I'm still stuck on the previous one
2011-02-27 13:48:37	@telemachus	I've done this book like three times, and *still* got it wrong again
2011-02-27 13:48:37	@telemachus	lol
2011-02-27 13:48:49	@telemachus	as trav would say "Ultimate face palm"
2011-02-27 13:48:53	fsmithred	how to exclude three matching characters in a row
2011-02-27 13:49:06	huggy-bear	haha
2011-02-27 13:49:15	huggy-bear	telemachus: but that gives us hope then :)
2011-02-27 13:49:27	@telemachus	that I'm dumb too?
2011-02-27 13:49:28	@telemachus	Oh, good
2011-02-27 13:49:31	@telemachus	glad I could help
2011-02-27 13:49:32	@telemachus	hah
2011-02-27 13:49:35	@telemachus	fsmithred: Huh?
2011-02-27 13:49:43	huggy-bear	telemachus: haha, no! that the best also make mistakes and forget things
2011-02-27 13:49:55	@telemachus	heh
2011-02-27 13:49:57	@telemachus	yeah, I know
2011-02-27 13:49:58	@telemachus	kidding
2011-02-27 13:50:00	@telemachus	but thanks
2011-02-27 13:50:10	fsmithred	include words with two matching characters in a row, exactly two
2011-02-27 13:50:14	fsmithred	but not three
2011-02-27 13:50:18	@telemachus	fsmithred: exclude three in a row...
2011-02-27 13:50:20	@telemachus	hmm
2011-02-27 13:50:34	@telemachus	/(.)\1[^\1]/?
2011-02-27 13:50:41	@telemachus	the question mark is me, not the regex
2011-02-27 13:50:44	fsmithred	that's why I asked if I can use & between two patterns
2011-02-27 13:51:01	@telemachus	fsmithred: I'm sorry, I missed that
2011-02-27 13:52:13	fsmithred	syntax error on that last one
2011-02-27 13:52:38	nadir	-> /(.)/1[^\1]/
2011-02-27 13:52:45	nadir	will not exclude three in a row.
2011-02-27 13:52:53	nadir	it will only match if two in a row are given
2011-02-27 13:52:54	huggy-bear	it excludes 2 in a row
2011-02-27 13:52:55	huggy-bear	no?
2011-02-27 13:53:09	nadir	which might be exactly what you want.
2011-02-27 13:53:14	huggy-bear	/(.)\1\1/
2011-02-27 13:53:17	nadir	but it is not: exclude three in a row.
2011-02-27 13:53:31	huggy-bear	no, wait
2011-02-27 13:53:55	huggy-bear	/^((.)\2\2)/
2011-02-27 13:54:01	huggy-bear	like this: /^((.)\2\2)/
2011-02-27 13:55:00	@telemachus	huggy-bear: No, I think
2011-02-27 13:55:05	@telemachus	^ at the front there is anchor
2011-02-27 13:55:07	@telemachus	not negation
2011-02-27 13:55:12	@telemachus	fsmithred: error on mine?
2011-02-27 13:55:19	fsmithred	yes
2011-02-27 13:56:02	huggy-bear	:(
2011-02-27 13:56:23	@telemachus	ah, sad
2011-02-27 13:56:25	@telemachus	one sec
2011-02-27 13:56:40	huggy-bear	no cookies for anchor!
2011-02-27 13:57:26	@telemachus	fsmithred: No error here https://gist.github.com/846427
2011-02-27 13:57:27	@telemachus	?
2011-02-27 13:58:46	fsmithred	if /(.)\1[^\1]/ {
2011-02-27 13:58:52	@telemachus	ah, no
2011-02-27 13:58:55	@telemachus	if (//)
2011-02-27 13:59:01	@telemachus	you need parens around the regex
2011-02-27 13:59:10	fsmithred	ah
2011-02-27 13:59:13	@telemachus	and those parens are for if, not for the regex
2011-02-27 13:59:16	@telemachus	if that makes sense
2011-02-27 13:59:38	fsmithred	A bird in hand...
2011-02-27 13:59:42	fsmithred	still shows up
2011-02-27 14:00:48	fsmithred	I don't understand
2011-02-27 14:01:02	fsmithred	it looks like it should work
2011-02-27 14:01:45	@telemachus	fsmithred: Because the match is made way earlier
2011-02-27 14:01:51	@telemachus	You're looking at it backwards
2011-02-27 14:02:12	@telemachus	a regex says "did you find *this match* anywhere", not "make sure not to find any other match anywhere"
2011-02-27 14:02:13	fsmithred	huh?
2011-02-27 14:02:22	@telemachus	wait
2011-02-27 14:02:23	@telemachus	sorry
2011-02-27 14:02:31	@telemachus	what did you mean?
2011-02-27 14:02:35	@telemachus	maybe I misunderstood
2011-02-27 14:03:00	fsmithred	find words with two matching characters, but exclude words with three matching characters (in a row)
2011-02-27 14:03:09	@telemachus	no, no
2011-02-27 14:03:14	@telemachus	that I got
2011-02-27 14:03:23	@telemachus	but what's bothering you
2011-02-27 14:03:33	fsmithred	hang on
2011-02-27 14:03:35	@telemachus	that "A bird in hand..." shows up?
2011-02-27 14:03:40	@telemachus	it *should* match
2011-02-27 14:03:55	fsmithred	it's got three dots in a row
2011-02-27 14:04:07	fsmithred	how to exclude that?
2011-02-27 14:04:19	@telemachus	show me your code, please
2011-02-27 14:04:22	fsmithred	find only words that have exactly two of the same character in a row
2011-02-27 14:04:35	fsmithred	I don't hvae code to do that
2011-02-27 14:04:52	@telemachus	show me the code you used that gave you the bad result
2011-02-27 14:04:53	@telemachus	please
2011-02-27 14:05:06	nadir	-> what he used: /(.)\1[^\1]/
2011-02-27 14:05:11	fsmithred	the bad result was from the code you gave me, before I put it in parens
2011-02-27 14:05:11	@telemachus	argh
2011-02-27 14:05:17	fsmithred	I'm not getting errors now
2011-02-27 14:05:17	@telemachus	I want the whole chunk of code
2011-02-27 14:05:19	@telemachus	please
2011-02-27 14:05:22	fsmithred	just not getting the desired result
2011-02-27 14:05:25	@telemachus	the whole little program
2011-02-27 14:05:28	nadir	-> what he used: /(.)\1[^\1]/
2011-02-27 14:05:37	@telemachus	nadir: I need a whole program
2011-02-27 14:05:40	@telemachus	not the regex
2011-02-27 14:06:06	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/846431
2011-02-27 14:06:29	@telemachus	ok, and what's in fred.txt?
2011-02-27 14:06:36	fsmithred	hang on

2011-02-27 14:06:58	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/846434
2011-02-27 14:07:14	@telemachus	awesome
2011-02-27 14:07:16	@telemachus	thanks
2011-02-27 14:07:23	@telemachus	Now, I claim that line 7 *should* match
2011-02-27 14:07:32	@telemachus	your code is doing exactly what you tell it to do
2011-02-27 14:07:44	@telemachus	can anyone see what matches in that line?
2011-02-27 14:08:04	fsmithred	yeah, everything with two or more matching characters in a row
2011-02-27 14:08:11	@telemachus	nope
2011-02-27 14:08:17	fsmithred	no?
2011-02-27 14:08:22	fsmithred	what are you getting?
2011-02-27 14:08:34	@telemachus	it matches exactly one char followed by itself followed by NOT THAT CHAR
2011-02-27 14:08:43	@telemachus	it matches the last two dots
2011-02-27 14:08:51	@telemachus	followed by END OF LINE
2011-02-27 14:09:13	@telemachus	That's what I was trying to explain to you
2011-02-27 14:09:22	@telemachus	your problem isn't the regex, it's the logic.
2011-02-27 14:09:24	nadir	umpf.
2011-02-27 14:09:28	nadir	That is a killer.
2011-02-27 14:09:30	@telemachus	You want to exclude, but you wrote a program to match.
2011-02-27 14:09:42	@telemachus	You need to reverse your logic.
2011-02-27 14:09:44	fsmithred	ok, but you wrote that line
2011-02-27 14:09:56	@telemachus	fsmithred: But I wrote it to match your requirements
2011-02-27 14:09:59	@telemachus	It does what you asked
2011-02-27 14:10:04	@telemachus	but what you asked isn't what you needed
2011-02-27 14:10:07	@telemachus	or something like that
2011-02-27 14:10:25	fsmithred	so, I still have a question
2011-02-27 14:10:38	fsmithred	can I use two patterns together with & like I can with |
2011-02-27 14:10:42	@telemachus	you said find only words that have exactly two of the same  character in a row
2011-02-27 14:10:49	fsmithred	so that one includes and one excludes?
2011-02-27 14:11:00	@telemachus	I found you exactly two of the same char in a row (followed by not that char)
2011-02-27 14:11:03	fsmithred	exactly two in a row means exclude three in a row
2011-02-27 14:11:06	@telemachus	no
2011-02-27 14:11:07	@telemachus	it does not
2011-02-27 14:11:14	@telemachus	... has two in a row
2011-02-27 14:11:20	@telemachus	this is exactly it
2011-02-27 14:11:21	fsmithred	ok, then like I asked at first
2011-02-27 14:11:25	fsmithred	exclude three in a row
2011-02-27 14:11:26	@telemachus	I'm excited
2011-02-27 14:11:27	@telemachus	sorry
2011-02-27 14:11:30	@telemachus	right
2011-02-27 14:11:31	@telemachus	bingo
2011-02-27 14:11:42	@telemachus	but exclude three in a row != find me exactly two in a row
2011-02-27 14:11:53	fsmithred	I've asked a few different ways
2011-02-27 14:12:11	@telemachus	right, and I don't mean to pick on you - I may have only responded to the one
2011-02-27 14:12:12	fsmithred	I want to print words that have two in a row but not more than two in a row
2011-02-27 14:12:18	@telemachus	yeah
2011-02-27 14:12:38	@telemachus	I'm just excited because this points to something VERY hard about regexes
2011-02-27 14:12:42	@telemachus	excluding is not what they do
2011-02-27 14:12:44	@telemachus	they match
2011-02-27 14:12:49	@telemachus	so you have to flip the logic
2011-02-27 14:12:51	@telemachus	one sec
2011-02-27 14:12:57	fsmithred	I have this idea that I can do something like /pattern&[^pattern2]/
2011-02-27 14:13:22	@telemachus	you could
2011-02-27 14:13:25	@telemachus	but there's an easier way
2011-02-27 14:13:26	@telemachus	actually
2011-02-27 14:13:28	@telemachus	woah
2011-02-27 14:13:29	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-27 14:13:31	@telemachus	you cant do that
2011-02-27 14:13:38	@telemachus	you could do /foo/ && /bar/
2011-02-27 14:13:41	@telemachus	but dont'
2011-02-27 14:13:42	@telemachus	wait
2011-02-27 14:13:43	@telemachus	lol

2011-02-27 14:17:57	fsmithred	looks good
2011-02-27 14:17:59	fsmithred	thanks
2011-02-27 14:18:03	fsmithred	gonna try it in a sec
2011-02-27 14:18:07	fsmithred	but one more question
2011-02-27 14:18:24	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 14:18:30	fsmithred	in the patterns that matched double characters, why isn't catch 22 showing up?
2011-02-27 14:18:59	@telemachus	hmm?
2011-02-27 14:19:04	@telemachus	it is for me
2011-02-27 14:19:32	@telemachus	were you using [a-z]?
2011-02-27 14:20:18	fsmithred	no
2011-02-27 14:20:27	fsmithred	last one works
2011-02-27 14:21:13	fsmithred		if (/(.)\1[^\1]/) doesn't show catch 22
2011-02-27 14:21:49	@telemachus	huh
2011-02-27 14:21:55	fsmithred	nor does my original answer 	if (/[\S\d](.)\g{-1}/)
2011-02-27 14:22:12	@telemachus	one sec, let me look
2011-02-27 14:23:14	@telemachus	It does here
2011-02-27 14:23:23	fsmithred	ok, I just figured out why mind doesn't work

2011-02-27 14:23:53	@telemachus	that's using the same regex I gave you that you quoted
2011-02-27 14:24:04	@telemachus	where it got 'A bird' still
2011-02-27 14:24:47	@telemachus	Can we talk for two more seconds about that whole business? Why it matched, why it's important?
2011-02-27 14:24:51	huggy-bear	I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have to go.
2011-02-27 14:24:54	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-02-27 14:24:57	@telemachus	that's a no then
2011-02-27 14:24:57	@telemachus	lol
2011-02-27 14:25:01	huggy-bear	for next week, it's just the next chapter?

2011-02-27 14:25:18	fsmithred	see you later, huggy-bear

2011-02-27 14:25:24	nadir	i am snoozing away tooo.

2011-02-27 14:27:18	nadir	before i slip of the chair it would be good to know what we go on with.
2011-02-27 14:27:35	@telemachus	ok, how about the next chapter?
2011-02-27 14:27:37	@telemachus	more regexes
2011-02-27 14:27:41	fsmithred	sounds good
2011-02-27 14:27:45	@telemachus	matching and substitution, I think
2011-02-27 14:28:00	@telemachus	ah, no, just matching
2011-02-27 14:28:04	@telemachus	substitution is 9
2011-02-27 14:28:12	@telemachus	they do it in slow pieces, which is probably good
2011-02-27 14:30:23	@telemachus	Ok, so 8 for next week then?
2011-02-27 14:30:28	@telemachus	And we'll stop for today
2011-02-27 14:30:37	@telemachus	I think I wore everyone down/confused everyone
2011-02-27 14:30:39	@telemachus	lol
2011-02-27 14:30:43	nadir	whew.
2011-02-27 14:30:59	fsmithred	I'm still stumped by why catch 22 comes up for you but not for me
2011-02-27 14:31:34	@telemachus	fsmithred: I'm not sure why either
2011-02-27 14:31:37	@telemachus	makes no sense
2011-02-27 14:31:58	fsmithred	you got white space after 22?
2011-02-27 14:32:04	fsmithred	when I add that, it comes up
2011-02-27 14:32:24	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846455
2011-02-27 14:32:30	@telemachus	That's exactly what I ran
2011-02-27 14:32:39	@telemachus	and I used the text in your file from the gist
2011-02-27 14:32:46	@telemachus	I didn't write my own, just copied yours
2011-02-27 14:33:20	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846434
2011-02-27 14:33:25	fsmithred	exactly same pattern
2011-02-27 14:33:27	@telemachus	That file was what I tested it against
2011-02-27 14:33:39	@telemachus	copy my file and that text file and try it again?
2011-02-27 14:34:02	fsmithred	doing it
2011-02-27 14:34:06	@telemachus	k
2011-02-27 14:34:56	fsmithred	no catch 22
2011-02-27 14:35:05	fsmithred	hm
2011-02-27 14:35:16	fsmithred	no tROLL, either
2011-02-27 14:35:45	@telemachus	I get both
2011-02-27 14:35:53	@telemachus	here's my output on exactly those two files
2011-02-27 14:36:56	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/846462
2011-02-27 14:36:59	@telemachus	I'm stumpted
2011-02-27 14:37:03	@telemachus	stumped
2011-02-27 14:37:03	@telemachus	even
2011-02-27 14:37:46	fsmithred	just those two lines I mentioned are missing
2011-02-27 14:37:51	fsmithred	could it be the chomp?
2011-02-27 14:38:29	@telemachus	yes, absolutely
2011-02-27 14:38:34	@telemachus	chomp changes everything
2011-02-27 14:38:47	@telemachus	"\n" is a character
2011-02-27 14:38:59	@telemachus	without it, 22 doesn't match
2011-02-27 14:39:05	@telemachus	since no char follows the second 2
2011-02-27 14:39:11	@telemachus	and ditto for tROLL
2011-02-27 14:39:13	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-27 14:39:19	@telemachus	that's it
2011-02-27 14:39:22	fsmithred	whew
2011-02-27 14:39:33	@telemachus	yup
2011-02-27 14:39:54	fsmithred	yup; they show up when I comment out that line
2011-02-27 14:39:56	@telemachus	sorry if I was confusing you earlier, but the whole issue of "find two" and "not three" tends to trip people up
2011-02-27 14:40:04	@telemachus	so I wanted to stress it
2011-02-27 14:40:14	@telemachus	there's a way in Perl to specify how many matches you want
2011-02-27 14:40:23	@telemachus	you know how + = 1 or more
2011-02-27 14:40:27	@telemachus	and ? = 0 or 1
2011-02-27 14:40:34	fsmithred	yeah, and there was a lot of conversation going on at the time
2011-02-27 14:40:46	fsmithred	yeah
2011-02-27 14:40:47	@telemachus	you can also say {2,4} - which means 2 or 3 or 4
2011-02-27 14:40:57	@telemachus	or even {2} - which means 2
2011-02-27 14:41:04	@telemachus	does that make sense so far?
2011-02-27 14:41:07	fsmithred	yes
2011-02-27 14:41:16	@telemachus	Ok, here's the slight mindbender
2011-02-27 14:41:22	@telemachus	if I say /.{2}/
2011-02-27 14:41:33	@telemachus	it *will* match "mooon"
2011-02-27 14:41:40	fsmithred	twice
2011-02-27 14:41:47	@telemachus	no, actually
2011-02-27 14:41:48	@telemachus	only once
2011-02-27 14:41:52	@telemachus	matching is yes or no
2011-02-27 14:41:54	fsmithred	no?
2011-02-27 14:41:57	fsmithred	well, ok
2011-02-27 14:41:58	@telemachus	for efficiency it stops at the first match
2011-02-27 14:42:06	fsmithred	but there are two ways it could match
2011-02-27 14:42:11	@telemachus	it matches the moment it sees the second o
2011-02-27 14:42:15	@telemachus	doesn't matter to Perl
2011-02-27 14:42:17	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-27 14:42:41	@telemachus	Perl says "start at beginning of string, try to match, keep trying until (1) string is ended or (2) I hit a match"
2011-02-27 14:43:04	@telemachus	in the case of "moooon", Perl stops at the 3rd letter
2011-02-27 14:43:08	fsmithred	yeah, that makes sense - it's a; computer
2011-02-27 14:43:21	fsmithred	they're pretty dumb
2011-02-27 14:43:24	@telemachus	but what trips many, many people up is that they say, hey /.{2}/ shouldn't match there
2011-02-27 14:43:30	@telemachus	since it's 4 not two
2011-02-27 14:43:39	@telemachus	that's the logic issue I was trying to explain
2011-02-27 14:43:54	@telemachus	Perl doesn't care what *else* happens. It saw two. It matches. Done.
2011-02-27 14:44:23	@telemachus	That's why I was stressing that 2 doesn't equal "not 3" if that makes sense.
2011-02-27 14:45:01	fsmithred	yes, I understand
2011-02-27 14:45:14	@telemachus	What bugs people is that when you read the docs, they describe {2} as matching _exactly_ 2. Which is true, but in an algebraic sense that most people don't think of at first.
2011-02-27 14:45:35	@telemachus	If I have four letter 'o's, then in the relevant sense I _also_ have 2.
2011-02-27 14:45:44	@telemachus	Which is freaky.
2011-02-27 14:46:02	@telemachus	Sorry, I'm a logic nerd.
2011-02-27 14:46:21	fsmithred	don't say "I got two pairs of Aces" when you're playing poker
2011-02-27 14:46:55	 *	telemachus laughs
2011-02-27 14:47:07	@telemachus	If I get that hand, I'll call 'em whatever I like.
2011-02-27 14:47:16	fsmithred	so, while I was searching for the answer to the first exercise
2011-02-27 14:47:26	fsmithred	I found some pieces that I could use
2011-02-27 14:47:33	@telemachus	Awesome
2011-02-27 14:47:36	fsmithred	and I wrote my first block of code for taskfer
2011-02-27 14:47:47	fsmithred	just a piece that searches for keyword
2011-02-27 14:48:03	@telemachus	Awesome
2011-02-27 14:48:14	fsmithred	yeah, I was pretty excited
2011-02-27 14:48:36	@telemachus	Very cool
2011-02-27 14:48:48	@telemachus	I spent hours and hours last night learning database stuff.
2011-02-27 14:48:49	fsmithred	can I show it to you?
2011-02-27 14:48:53	@telemachus	Fun but I'm beat.
2011-02-27 14:49:02	@telemachus	Actually, do you mind if I take half a raincheck?
2011-02-27 14:49:06	fsmithred	np
2011-02-27 14:49:08	@telemachus	email me a link and I can get back to you?
2011-02-27 14:49:13	fsmithred	sure
2011-02-27 14:49:15	fsmithred	thanks
2011-02-27 14:49:18	fsmithred	um
2011-02-27 14:49:24	@telemachus	I was about to say - time for me to walk out in the air and clear my head and do errands
2011-02-27 14:49:28	fsmithred	email address that I have?
2011-02-27 14:49:29	@telemachus	telemachus@arpinum.org
2011-02-27 14:49:33	@telemachus	:)
2011-02-27 14:49:46	fsmithred	thanks
2011-02-27 14:49:47	@telemachus	Not sure what you have, but that one always works
2011-02-27 14:49:59	@telemachus	nadir: You fall off your chair?
2011-02-27 14:50:05	fsmithred	I got one with your real name
2011-02-27 14:50:06	nadir	nearly.
2011-02-27 14:50:10	@telemachus	peter@aronoff.org
2011-02-27 14:50:12	@telemachus	that works too
2011-02-27 14:50:37	@telemachus	I'm comfortable with you using either or both, not a big deal to me.
2011-02-27 14:51:49	fsmithred	outside sounds like a good idea
2011-02-27 14:52:24	@telemachus	Yeah
2011-02-27 14:52:36	fsmithred	take it easy, and thanks again
2011-02-27 14:52:38	@telemachus	I'm a little woozy-headed. Too much computer time.
2011-02-27 14:52:48	@telemachus	Thanks. Hope I didn't drive you nuts earlier.
2011-02-27 14:52:56	fsmithred	just a little

2011-02-27 14:53:04	nadir	i was made that way.
2011-02-27 14:53:09	@telemachus	Let me know if any of those examples still don't make sense.
2011-02-27 14:53:09	nadir	serious: no.
2011-02-27 14:53:11	fsmithred	but I figured it would eventually get cleared up
2011-02-27 14:53:15	@telemachus	And we can talk more next week.
2011-02-27 14:53:22	fsmithred	ok
2011-02-27 14:53:25	@telemachus	Yeah, I sensed you half wanted to punch me, lol.
2011-02-27 14:53:34	fsmithred	nah
2011-02-27 14:53:35	@telemachus	Recheck why that bird in hand... does match.
2011-02-27 14:53:44	@telemachus	You should get that - it's a good test - hard but good.
2011-02-27 14:53:46	fsmithred	takes a lot to get me riled up
2011-02-27 14:54:35	fsmithred	makes sense
2011-02-27 14:54:37	fsmithred	I think
2011-02-27 14:54:42	@telemachus	Cool
2011-02-27 14:54:48	@telemachus	and glad no punching :)
2011-02-27 14:54:49	fsmithred	I got lots of examples to play with
2011-02-27 14:54:53	@telemachus	All right, I'm out for now
2011-02-27 14:54:58	fsmithred	bye
2011-02-27 14:55:05	@telemachus	I'll gist up next week and change the topic - forgot this week

2011-03-01 17:58:04	@antinoos	<telemachus/#study-group/2011-03-01> Are you sourcing Perlbrew in your shell? [[ -f $HOME/$PERLBREW_ROOT/etc/bashrc ]] && source $HOME/$PERLBREW_ROOT/etc/bashrc (vel sim)

2011-03-01 18:03:42	@telemachus	dbbolton: Huh. To be honest, I follow the progress on Github not CPAN, so I've never noticed that.
2011-03-01 18:05:46	dbbolton	there are actually two cpan pages, and i was looking at the wrong one
2011-03-01 18:06:27	dbbolton	http://search.cpan.org/~gugod/App-perlbrew-0.16/bin/perlbrew
2011-03-01 18:06:49	@telemachus	Ah, right, I was about to say I see a small mention here perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl in the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to ~/perl5/perlbrew, and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You then can benefit from not having to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan modules because those are installed inside your HOME too. It's a compl
2011-03-01 18:07:30	@telemachus	When you first run the app (perlbrew init), I think it prompts you to do it, but again it's probably easy to miss.
2011-03-01 18:07:48	@telemachus	I had a leg up: perlbrew works just like rvm (for ruby), so I was used to the procedure
2011-03-01 18:08:31	dbbolton	i read over the bashrc file and i really don't see what it's supposed to do besides create the init file and change the PATH
2011-03-01 18:08:44	dbbolton	but it worked.
2011-03-01 18:08:59	@telemachus	and change  the PATH
2011-03-01 18:09:04	@telemachus	that's the key
2011-03-01 18:09:26	dbbolton	here's the thing though. when i echo $PATH it's the same as it was before
2011-03-01 18:09:33	@telemachus	run echo $PATH and then $PATH_WITHOUT_PERLBREW
2011-03-01 18:09:44	@telemachus	huh?
2011-03-01 18:09:54	@telemachus	those two should be different
2011-03-01 18:10:06	@telemachus	here's a better way: env | grep -i perl
2011-03-01 18:10:48	dbbolton	never mind, i was in an old shell
2011-03-01 18:10:58	dbbolton	that's so annoying
2011-03-01 18:11:59	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-03-01 18:13:33	dbbolton	i really don't understand why the author doesn't just tell you to modify your path, because i did that on a new shell without sourcing the 'bashrc' and it worked
2011-03-01 18:14:45	dbbolton	http://paste.debian.net/109312/
2011-03-01 18:15:19	dbbolton	that's how the zsh userguide recommends adding new directories to PATH to avoid duplicates
2011-03-01 18:16:29	@telemachus	dbbolton: His script does a little more than just the path
2011-03-01 18:16:42	@telemachus	it also exports a few useful vars into your environment
2011-03-01 18:16:49	@telemachus	I use one of them for vim
2011-03-01 18:17:02	@telemachus	PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 18:17:24	@telemachus	It also maintains a PATH_WITHOUT_PERLBREW var for use in scripting, which is nice
2011-03-01 18:18:48	dbbolton	in the bashrc file, the two instances of PERLBREW_PERL are preceded by 'unset'
2011-03-01 18:20:47	@telemachus	hmm, fair enough
2011-03-01 18:21:05	@telemachus	I haven't read through the code closely enough to say one way or the other _where_ it happens.
2011-03-01 18:21:10	@telemachus	But the var is definitely out there.
2011-03-01 18:21:31	dbbolton	`env | grep -i perl` doesn't show it (in the shell where i sourced the bashrc file)
2011-03-01 18:21:47	@telemachus	What version of perlbrew are you on?
2011-03-01 18:21:55	@telemachus	the var is new-ish in the environment
2011-03-01 18:21:55	dbbolton	0.16
2011-03-01 18:22:34	@telemachus	hmm, maybe he removed it again? I'm on 0.15 here actually
2011-03-01 18:22:44	@telemachus	I definitely have it
2011-03-01 18:22:54	@telemachus	(maybe it's a zsh vs bash thing?)
2011-03-01 18:25:23	dbbolton	i think env vars are set the same as in bash
2011-03-01 18:25:55	dbbolton	it must be the line:     command perlbrew $short_option env $1 >> $HOME/.perlbrew/init
2011-03-01 18:26:23	@telemachus	ah, yup
2011-03-01 18:26:28	dbbolton	because it's only producing PERLBREW_{ROOT,PATH,VERSION}
2011-03-01 18:27:00	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/850117
2011-03-01 18:27:07	@telemachus	He changed that? Fuck.
2011-03-01 18:28:44	dbbolton	gist your version of the bashrc file and i'll diff it

2011-03-01 18:30:13	dbbolton	yep
2011-03-01 18:30:23	@telemachus	what's different?
2011-03-01 18:30:41	dbbolton	short_option is missing
2011-03-01 18:31:28	dbbolton	actually it might still be null when that fuction is called
2011-03-01 18:31:59	@telemachus	oh, wait, wait wait
2011-03-01 18:32:07	@telemachus	have you installed a perlbrew perl yet?
2011-03-01 18:32:12	@telemachus	and switched to it?
2011-03-01 18:32:21	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-01 18:32:39	@telemachus	I'm so confused
2011-03-01 18:32:49	@telemachus	I'm looking at Github and I don't see him removing that option
2011-03-01 18:33:01	@telemachus	cat you gist your bashrc?

2011-03-01 18:33:27	dbbolton	i don't know how 'gentoo eclass' got there
2011-03-01 18:37:14	@telemachus	ok, one more question - how did you install?
2011-03-01 18:38:17	dbbolton	perlbrew?
2011-03-01 18:38:22	@telemachus	yeah
2011-03-01 18:38:27	@telemachus	I still have PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 18:38:42	@telemachus	and I'm upgraded to 0.16
2011-03-01 18:38:45	dbbolton	./perlbrew install
2011-03-01 18:39:00	dbbolton	changed PERLBREW_ROOT first
2011-03-01 18:39:33	@telemachus	Here's a thought: change PERLBREW_ROOT to something random, then run this: curl -L http://xrl.us/perlbrewinstall | bash
2011-03-01 18:39:46	@telemachus	then you can diff the /etc/bashrc file
2011-03-01 18:40:00	@telemachus	I can't figure out if I have an old one somehow or you do
2011-03-01 18:40:09	@telemachus	I think you do, but I"m unsure
2011-03-01 18:41:29	@telemachus	Yeah, this is current on github https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/lib/App/perlbrew.pm
2011-03-01 18:41:37	@telemachus	short_option is in there
2011-03-01 18:41:50	dbbolton	mine has that
2011-03-01 18:43:40	@telemachus	ah, I'm looking backwards sorry
2011-03-01 18:43:48	@telemachus	Yours has, mine doesn't
2011-03-01 18:43:49	@telemachus	k
2011-03-01 18:44:10	dbbolton	i think i'm just going to try installing it from scratch
2011-03-01 18:44:46	@telemachus	hmm
2011-03-01 18:45:17	@telemachus	ok, fuck me
2011-03-01 18:45:22	@telemachus	If I unset PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 18:45:31	@telemachus	and then source _your_ bashrc file
2011-03-01 18:45:34	@telemachus	it reappears
2011-03-01 18:45:41	@telemachus	(I checked in between - it was unset)
2011-03-01 18:45:47	@telemachus	so I think it's at your end
2011-03-01 18:45:55	@telemachus	I'm going to stick with that story
2011-03-01 18:46:00	dbbolton	how does that file set that var?
2011-03-01 18:46:46	dbbolton	did perlbrew/init already have it?
2011-03-01 18:46:55	@telemachus	grumble
2011-03-01 18:46:57	@telemachus	maybe
2011-03-01 18:46:58	@telemachus	fuck
2011-03-01 18:48:00	@telemachus	ok, now it's gone
2011-03-01 18:48:06	@telemachus	If I nuke .perlbrew/init
2011-03-01 18:48:35	@telemachus	and yes it no longer exports that value
2011-03-01 18:48:37	@telemachus	fuck fuck fuck
2011-03-01 18:53:51	dbbolton	what is the PERLBREW_PERL var useful for in vim?
2011-03-01 18:54:16	@telemachus	it's the only way to get the currently running perl on your status line without endless system calls
2011-03-01 18:54:43	@telemachus	it makes this possible: https://github.com/telemachus/vim-perlbrew
2011-03-01 19:03:50	@telemachus	I'm still fairly confused
2011-03-01 19:04:01	dbbolton	yeah, i have no idea
2011-03-01 19:04:06	@telemachus	Looking at the code for 0.16, perlbrew_env should still return PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 19:04:24	@telemachus	https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/lib/App/perlbrew.pm#L570-575
2011-03-01 19:05:11	@telemachus	I just nuked my whole installation and started over
2011-03-01 19:05:12	@telemachus	we'll see
2011-03-01 19:07:39	dbbolton	oh great, my ext4 partition is now wigging out
2011-03-01 19:07:45	@telemachus	lol
2011-03-01 19:09:30	dbbolton	or maybe the nfs
2011-03-01 19:09:53	dbbolton	if you try to ls /mnt (where they are mounted) the shell freezes
2011-03-01 19:10:15	dbbolton	or even using tab completion will freeze it
2011-03-01 19:10:54	dbbolton	gonna restart

2011-03-01 19:16:03	@telemachus	ok - tough night for us
2011-03-01 19:17:10	dbbolton	did i miss anything
2011-03-01 19:18:52	@telemachus	I doubt it
2011-03-01 19:21:57	dbbolton	working on a clean install now, 5.12.3 is building
2011-03-01 19:22:25	@telemachus	mine is finished
2011-03-01 19:22:32	@telemachus	the result is weird
2011-03-01 19:22:41	@telemachus	perlbrew env no longer shows PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 19:23:04	@telemachus	however, if I do perlbrew switch perl-5.12.3 && echo $PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 19:23:07	@telemachus	it shows up
2011-03-01 19:23:12	@telemachus	if I then run perlbrew off
2011-03-01 19:23:17	@telemachus	it's gone (as it should be)
2011-03-01 19:23:25	@telemachus	switch back; it's back (as it should be)
2011-03-01 19:24:09	@telemachus	it's back in my init
2011-03-01 19:24:30	@telemachus	and it gets removed if I run perlbrew off
2011-03-01 19:24:35	@telemachus	and put back when I switch back
2011-03-01 19:26:14	dbbolton	sounds like an issue-filing is in order
2011-03-01 19:27:05	dbbolton	i just got to the bottom of the frozen NFS
2011-03-01 19:27:27	dbbolton	the power went out
2011-03-01 19:28:12	dbbolton	so the laptop (client) was connected to an NFS that was no longer running since the desktop (server) didn't stay on
2011-03-01 19:28:37	@telemachus	dbbolton: I don't want to file an issue. It works here. Don't make him break it for me. :)
2011-03-01 19:28:44	dbbolton	i would think that there would be better handling of outages like that though
2011-03-01 19:29:04	dbbolton	oh, i read the description wrong
2011-03-01 19:29:08	@telemachus	Urg. I find many newtworked apps do _bad_ things when they lose a connection.
2011-03-01 19:29:11	@telemachus	Sorry?
2011-03-01 19:30:02	dbbolton	it sounded like it was unexpectedly disappearing
2011-03-01 19:30:24	@telemachus	ah, no, it disappears expectedly.
2011-03-01 19:31:00	@telemachus	In short: if I'm using a perlbrew perl, it's there. If I switch back to /usr/bin/perl, it goes away. Both behaviors are correct (in my eyes).
2011-03-01 19:31:29	dbbolton	i'll bet i was running the perlbrew script instead of the shell function when i switched
2011-03-01 19:31:53	dbbolton	i'll find out as soon as this damn build finishes
2011-03-01 19:33:51	@telemachus	Right, I was thinking that your differences were due to something like that - your earlier environment.
2011-03-01 19:33:58	@telemachus	And, yes, the build takes for-fucking-ever.
2011-03-01 19:36:20	dbbolton	do you usually build with or without threading support?
2011-03-01 19:36:42	@telemachus	Whatever the default is, frankly
2011-03-01 19:36:57	@telemachus	I can barely write non-concurrent code.
2011-03-01 19:37:05	@telemachus	I've never tried to write threaded apps
2011-03-01 19:37:16	@telemachus	but I also can't be bothered to tell Perl to leave it out.
2011-03-01 19:37:26	dbbolton	i think it must be 'no', because i got a bunch of messages about threading being disabled in build.log
2011-03-01 19:37:37	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-01 19:38:08	dbbolton	still no PERLBREW_PERL var
2011-03-01 19:38:16	dbbolton	after switching
2011-03-01 19:39:13	@telemachus	hmm
2011-03-01 19:39:47	dbbolton	at least not from 'perlbrew env'
2011-03-01 19:39:54	@telemachus	ah, no, that's right
2011-03-01 19:40:00	@telemachus	echo $PERLBREW_PERL
2011-03-01 19:40:20	dbbolton	but why doesn't `perlbre env` show it
2011-03-01 19:40:23	@telemachus	perlbrew env does not have it
2011-03-01 19:40:39	@telemachus	he trimmed it from there, but it's still exported and placed in init
2011-03-01 19:41:03	dbbolton	any particular reason why he took it out
2011-03-01 19:41:13	@telemachus	when you call echo $PERLBREW_PERL, do you get a result?
2011-03-01 19:41:18	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-01 19:41:26	@telemachus	No idea why he removed it from `perlbrew env`
2011-03-01 19:41:46	dbbolton	i just thought it would be more convenient to see all the perlbrew-related vars at once
2011-03-01 19:41:52	@telemachus	agreed
2011-03-01 19:42:04	@telemachus	I'm confused about this all around
2011-03-01 19:42:09	dbbolton	i'm posting it as a feature request
2011-03-01 19:42:14	@telemachus	cool
2011-03-01 19:45:00	dbbolton	is there a way to make multi-line code blocks in github markdown
2011-03-01 19:45:11	dbbolton	similar to `` but not in-line
2011-03-01 19:46:29	@telemachus	sure - two ways, I think
2011-03-01 19:46:34	dbbolton	indent 4 spaces?
2011-03-01 19:46:38	@telemachus	if there are no spaces, then yeah
2011-03-01 19:46:42	@telemachus	that's way 1
2011-03-01 19:46:59	@telemachus	if there are blocks with some empty lines, indent 8 spaces - two full tabstops
2011-03-01 19:47:12	dbbolton	cool
2011-03-01 19:47:12	@telemachus	do you use discount?
2011-03-01 19:47:15	dbbolton	no
2011-03-01 19:47:26	@telemachus	It's the finest markdown implementation I know
2011-03-01 19:47:34	@telemachus	and written in C, so blazingly fast
2011-03-01 19:47:44	dbbolton	that's pretty suprising
2011-03-01 19:47:46	@telemachus	http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/
2011-03-01 19:47:52	@telemachus	which part?
2011-03-01 19:48:18	dbbolton	the fact that it's not written in ruby or python or something
2011-03-01 19:48:22	@telemachus	ah
2011-03-01 19:48:47	@telemachus	yeah, I've seen a handful of implementations in exotic languages now (pandoc is in haskell - it's also pretty cool)
2011-03-01 19:48:55	@telemachus	but I love discount
2011-03-01 19:49:12	@telemachus	random, but you asked about markdown
2011-03-01 19:49:27	@telemachus	he's starting to add features from github markdown
2011-03-01 19:50:12	dbbolton	i just recently discoved that you can export a file with the current syntax highlighting/colorscheme to html from vim
2011-03-01 19:50:34	dbbolton	kate had something like that, but vim's is way better
2011-03-01 19:51:16	@telemachus	yeah, textmate (OSX) does something like that as well
2011-03-01 19:52:04	dbbolton	the substitutions in discount remind me of the special letter script i was working on
2011-03-01 19:52:30	dbbolton	if i knew C i would whip up a patch
2011-03-01 19:53:57	dbbolton	well, i would think about doing that anyway
2011-03-01 20:52:04	dbbolton	!memo telemachus would you mind sharing that link about building your first perl module again? i don't have it bookmarked on either of my computers here
2011-03-01 20:52:05	@antinoos	Added memo for telemachus
2011-03-01 20:52:18	@telemachus	Sure

2011-03-01 20:53:12	@telemachus	but all the tips are good - though some are slightly out of date
2011-03-01 20:54:20	dbbolton	got any tips on synchronizing bookmarks
2011-03-01 20:55:10	dbbolton	i used to have some FF extension but it was so clunky
2011-03-01 21:27:14	@telemachus	Pinboard
2011-03-01 21:27:27	@telemachus	I don't do in browser bookmarks any more, at all

2011-03-01 21:28:09	@telemachus	It's a pay service (small, one-time fee), but I think it's worth it.
2011-03-01 21:28:19	@telemachus	Devs are cool as well. Very helpful.
2011-03-01 21:28:30	@telemachus	All right, I need to do something about food.

2011-03-03 20:09:51	dbbolton	sweet
2011-03-03 20:09:53	nadir	but it is not so good for my perl/bash learning.
2011-03-03 20:09:55	nadir	yes.
2011-03-03 20:10:00	dbbolton	why not
2011-03-03 20:10:17	nadir	i am fighting with the laptop related things.
2011-03-03 20:10:23	nadir	so: less energy.
2011-03-03 20:10:35	nadir	I never ever dealt with wifi, to give an example.
2011-03-03 20:10:35	dbbolton	like wireless, suspend, etc.
2011-03-03 20:10:38	nadir	yup
2011-03-03 20:10:57	dbbolton	are you using wpa supplicant

2011-03-03 20:11:12	nadir	I ain't got a wireless router.
2011-03-03 20:11:16	dbbolton	ah
2011-03-03 20:11:20	nadir	I use external networks.
2011-03-03 20:11:25	nadir	or: that is what i try.
2011-03-03 20:11:35	dbbolton	so you need a scanning tool
2011-03-03 20:11:45	nadir	mhh...
2011-03-03 20:11:53	nadir	like wicd? or ?
2011-03-03 20:11:56	dbbolton	to see which networks are available
2011-03-03 20:12:15	nadir	wicd seems to do that.
2011-03-03 20:12:34	nadir	all is a bit confusing.
2011-03-03 20:12:49	nadir	reading would probably help. :-)

2011-03-03 20:13:27	nadir	let me write that down.

2011-03-03 20:15:21	nadir	there seem to be some "friendly" people around which use unsecured.
2011-03-03 20:15:38	nadir	to be even more friendly: they live the router switched on...
2011-03-03 20:15:47	dbbolton	nice

2011-03-03 20:15:55	nadir	yup
2011-03-03 20:16:14	nadir	i will mainly need it at a cafe, and there i will get the passwd anyway.
2011-03-03 20:16:25	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-03 20:17:03	nadir	how long does a laptop need to be loaded (the battery) ?
2011-03-03 20:17:12	dbbolton	to charge it?
2011-03-03 20:17:16	nadir	yes.
2011-03-03 20:17:27	dbbolton	it depends on the capcity of the battery
2011-03-03 20:17:35	dbbolton	i think mine is a 9-cell
2011-03-03 20:17:51	dbbolton	it will charge in 30 minutes or so (completely)
2011-03-03 20:17:57	nadir	ah, oh.
2011-03-03 20:18:00	nadir	that is fast.
2011-03-03 20:18:06	dbbolton	it can run off the battery for about 2 hours
2011-03-03 20:19:14	dbbolton	well i need to get some dinner
2011-03-03 20:19:14	nadir	i paid 350, which is ok.

2011-03-05 13:00:42	fsmithred	hey nadir!
2011-03-05 13:00:51	nadir	perfect.
2011-03-05 13:00:52	nadir	:-)
2011-03-05 13:00:57	fsmithred	hi
2011-03-05 13:01:02	nadir	hi .
2011-03-05 13:01:06	fsmithred	what are we doing here?
2011-03-05 13:01:12	nadir	i was not sure if you would come, hence the perfect.
2011-03-05 13:01:24	nadir	good question, saturday, and we sit here...
2011-03-05 13:01:34	nadir	a bless or a curse?
2011-03-05 13:01:35	fsmithred	I actually showed up about half an hour ago to check if you were here
2011-03-05 13:01:38	fsmithred	both
2011-03-05 13:01:45	nadir	:-)
2011-03-05 13:01:56	fsmithred	um...
2011-03-05 13:02:11	fsmithred	teacher is keeping tabs on us, so I'm a little reluctant to say
2011-03-05 13:02:12	nadir	first things first:
2011-03-05 13:02:17	fsmithred	I haven't done my homework yet
2011-03-05 13:02:40	nadir	i was mainly busy with my laptop, so am missing the actual development (<- so to speak)
2011-03-05 13:02:55	nadir	which teacher?
2011-03-05 13:02:58	fsmithred	devel of what?
2011-03-05 13:02:59	fsmithred	tele
2011-03-05 13:03:05	nadir	ah, yes.
2011-03-05 13:03:15	nadir	devel -> your new scripts.
2011-03-05 13:03:19	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 13:03:28	fsmithred	you should encrypt the laptop
2011-03-05 13:03:32	nadir	seems to work well, right?
2011-03-05 13:03:36	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 13:03:37	nadir	good that you say that.
2011-03-05 13:03:42	fsmithred	I'm testing it now
2011-03-05 13:03:45	nadir	can i do it _afterwards ?
2011-03-05 13:03:49	fsmithred	no
2011-03-05 13:03:57	nadir	fuck, fuck , fuck.
2011-03-05 13:04:00	fsmithred	has to be encrypted before you write to it
2011-03-05 13:04:19	nadir	can i add a grub-pwd afterwards?
2011-03-05 13:04:35	fsmithred	unless you want to copy everything to external drive, re-format, then copy back while it's running on live-cd
2011-03-05 13:04:52	nadir	mhh...
2011-03-05 13:04:56	fsmithred	yeah, I think you can add grub password later, but that's not very secure
2011-03-05 13:05:02	fsmithred	other solution...
2011-03-05 13:05:08	fsmithred	don't lose it
2011-03-05 13:05:08	nadir	rather that then re-installing, but i don't think i got 320GB free.
2011-03-05 13:05:18	nadir	i see.
2011-03-05 13:05:31	nadir	It is not that i got stuff i would need to worry about, but still.
2011-03-05 13:06:08	fsmithred	what do you mean about 320GB free?
2011-03-05 13:06:15	fsmithred	you filled it already?
2011-03-05 13:06:22	nadir	most of it.
2011-03-05 13:06:32	fsmithred	wow
2011-03-05 13:06:32	nadir	I copied all users-data.
2011-03-05 13:06:35	fsmithred	lotta movies?
2011-03-05 13:06:40	nadir	most of that is music.
2011-03-05 13:06:49	nadir	I think i skipped the few movies i got.
2011-03-05 13:07:03	fsmithred	that's a lot of music
2011-03-05 13:07:12	fsmithred	speaking of...
2011-03-05 13:07:21	fsmithred	I'm glad I got turned on to last-fm
2011-03-05 13:07:27	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-05 13:07:44	nadir	yup, thanks too.
2011-03-05 13:07:48	fsmithred	shell-fm if pretty cool
2011-03-05 13:07:54	nadir	after it it seems very easy, but i had no luck.
2011-03-05 13:08:11	fsmithred	stuff that frood wrote is way too complicated
2011-03-05 13:08:16	nadir	btw, i need to turn on music.
2011-03-05 13:08:22	nadir	yup, i think so too.
2011-03-05 13:08:30	nadir	i like the notify-send solution a lot.
2011-03-05 13:08:36	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 13:08:54	nadir	that bugged me with lastfm, that i never knew what i was listening too.
2011-03-05 13:08:56	fsmithred	conky is cool, too, but I'd have to change the entire arrangement of my conky to use it for that
2011-03-05 13:09:17	fsmithred	you run it in the background?
2011-03-05 13:09:39	nadir	no, i could not figure out how that works.
2011-03-05 13:09:47	nadir	but i don't check for each new song.
2011-03-05 13:09:55	nadir	I open it in terminal, desktop one,
2011-03-05 13:10:01	nadir	and do my other stuff on other terminals
2011-03-05 13:10:03	fsmithred	yeah, having to go back to the terminal every time would be a pain
2011-03-05 13:10:07	nadir	terminals -> desktops
2011-03-05 13:11:00	nadir	you realize that you are on the way to become a real bash-geek?
2011-03-05 13:11:13	fsmithred	um
2011-03-05 13:11:17	fsmithred	still got a ways to go
2011-03-05 13:11:23	nadir	no um.
2011-03-05 13:11:28	nadir	You do funky stuff.
2011-03-05 13:11:30	nadir	really.
2011-03-05 13:11:30	fsmithred	I found a bash book (pdf) on my hard drive last night
2011-03-05 13:11:33	fsmithred	read a bit of it
2011-03-05 13:11:39	fsmithred	understood none of it
2011-03-05 13:11:50	nadir	now i had to laugh loud.
2011-03-05 13:11:55	nadir	i know that feeling.
2011-03-05 13:12:17	fsmithred	fuck
2011-03-05 13:12:27	fsmithred	ok, there's a problem with the script
2011-03-05 13:12:34	nadir	?
2011-03-05 13:12:41	fsmithred	if you run it and install with separate /home
2011-03-05 13:12:58	fsmithred	then run it again before rebooting and don't use a separate /home
2011-03-05 13:13:09	fsmithred	then /home is still listed in the excludes file
2011-03-05 13:13:17	nadir	well.
2011-03-05 13:13:19	fsmithred	and you end up with no home to log into
2011-03-05 13:13:25	nadir	I for one can live with that.
2011-03-05 13:13:33	fsmithred	should probably delete the excludes file before creating it
2011-03-05 13:13:34	nadir	at least at the moment.
2011-03-05 13:13:49	nadir	it is called refractainstaller3.sh ?
2011-03-05 13:13:59	fsmithred	yeah, it's only going to affect edge cases
2011-03-05 13:14:15	fsmithred	maybe 1% of the six refracta users
2011-03-05 13:14:21	nadir	ah, btw:
2011-03-05 13:14:25	fsmithred	I'm testing zinstaller.01
2011-03-05 13:14:39	fsmithred	but I guess it's in both
2011-03-05 13:14:41	nadir	 i changed /home/user/excludes to ./excludes, and that did work. that is very good.
2011-03-05 13:15:02	nadir	what is 1% of six?
2011-03-05 13:15:03	fsmithred	yeah, I was thinking of putting $(pwd) last night
2011-03-05 13:15:06	nadir	mhh....
2011-03-05 13:15:09	fsmithred	nobody yet
2011-03-05 13:15:09	nadir	perhaps an arm.
2011-03-05 13:15:13	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 13:17:49	nadir	could you add something like
2011-03-05 13:18:09	nadir	if [[ -z home_dev ]] then sed "remove /home from excludes"
2011-03-05 13:18:28	nadir	or vice versa or so?
2011-03-05 13:18:37	fsmithred	oh, that should work
2011-03-05 13:18:53	nadir	easy workaround...
2011-03-05 13:18:57	fsmithred	that way, if someone has made a custom excludes file, it won't mess with any other customizations
2011-03-05 13:19:11	fsmithred	can't imagine what customizations anyone would use, but...
2011-03-05 13:19:21	fsmithred	don't want to restrict anyone
2011-03-05 13:19:47	nadir	shall i test an encrypted version, or does it work anyway?
2011-03-05 13:19:57	nadir	i don't see much use in tests, they all work.
2011-03-05 13:20:10	fsmithred	it works
2011-03-05 13:20:21	fsmithred	today I tried encrypting just one partition
2011-03-05 13:20:53	fsmithred	just /home, just / and maybe just / with no separate home
2011-03-05 13:21:09	fsmithred	I think that might be what I'm doing now
2011-03-05 13:21:38	fsmithred	not sure
2011-03-05 13:21:41	fsmithred	I lost track
2011-03-05 13:21:48	fsmithred	nothing is encrypted on this one
2011-03-05 13:22:11	nadir	i am booting refracat-3-version
2011-03-05 13:22:27	nadir	then i need to grep the refracta-directory from git.
2011-03-05 13:22:34	nadir	I got one idea.
2011-03-05 13:22:38	fsmithred	?
2011-03-05 13:22:49	nadir	If we can convince Dean to add your_github/refracta
2011-03-05 13:22:52	nadir	to the iso
2011-03-05 13:22:59	nadir	it is much easier to run testst
2011-03-05 13:23:01	nadir	tests
2011-03-05 13:23:07	nadir	git pull upstream master
2011-03-05 13:23:14	nadir	and one has got all the code at hand.
2011-03-05 13:23:22	fsmithred	oh, what I've been doing is run an extra vm, and put the scripts there
2011-03-05 13:23:24	nadir	but perhaps it is too much of fiddling.
2011-03-05 13:23:31	fsmithred	then ssh into that vm from refracta
2011-03-05 13:23:35	fsmithred	to get the script
2011-03-05 13:23:49	nadir	still a bit of trouble.
2011-03-05 13:23:56	fsmithred	Aunt Martha don't want no git repo on her cd
2011-03-05 13:24:02	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 13:24:05	nadir	so shall it be.
2011-03-05 13:24:08	fsmithred	plus...
2011-03-05 13:24:16	fsmithred	someone might find something dangerous and use it
2011-03-05 13:24:26	nadir	that is a good point.
2011-03-05 13:24:33	nadir	for me it would be a little comfort.
2011-03-05 13:24:40	nadir	but it works the way it is too.
2011-03-05 13:25:03	fsmithred	the way I've been doing it is pretty easy
2011-03-05 13:25:17	nadir	seems like at least rsync is installed on the new version. that helps already.
2011-03-05 13:25:26	fsmithred	terminal on host is in my scripts dir, sftp into the first vm
2011-03-05 13:25:32	fsmithred	boot the cd in vm,
2011-03-05 13:25:40	fsmithred	sftp from host to vm1
2011-03-05 13:25:48	fsmithred	sftp to vm1 from refracta
2011-03-05 13:26:13	fsmithred	if I open extra tabs in terminal, I can leave the sftp connection up
2011-03-05 13:26:42	fsmithred	then just test, edit on host, hit the up arrow and transfer (do that one on the host to push, once on refracta to pull)
2011-03-05 13:28:29	nadir	I am in Vbox.
2011-03-05 13:28:29	fsmithred	hm, I fixed the missing home problem, and now I got GREEN
2011-03-05 13:28:36	nadir	I did sftp user@host
2011-03-05 13:28:44	nadir	if i want to get refracta dir,
2011-03-05 13:28:48	nadir	i do
2011-03-05 13:28:52	nadir	get refracata?
2011-03-05 13:28:53	fsmithred	get whatever
2011-03-05 13:29:00	nadir	whatever?
2011-03-05 13:29:01	fsmithred	not sure if you'll get a directory
2011-03-05 13:29:02	nadir	hahaha.
2011-03-05 13:29:04	nadir	sorry.
2011-03-05 13:29:16	fsmithred	you might have to make a dir
2011-03-05 13:29:23	fsmithred	then you can get files
2011-03-05 13:29:26	fsmithred	globbing works
2011-03-05 13:29:32	fsmithred	get * might work
2011-03-05 13:29:56	nadir	dir did not work, i picked them one by one.
2011-03-05 13:29:58	nadir	thanks.
2011-03-05 13:30:09	nadir	i always mix get and what else is there.
2011-03-05 13:31:09	fsmithred	part of the reason I keep changing names is so that I can use tab-complete and not type a lot
2011-03-05 13:31:23	nadir	yes, i know.
2011-03-05 13:31:30	fsmithred	oh
2011-03-05 13:31:35	fsmithred	thought of another issue today
2011-03-05 13:31:35	nadir	i do that too, now and then.
2011-03-05 13:31:51	fsmithred	when it encrypts a partition, it does not write random data to it
2011-03-05 13:32:04	fsmithred	so if you're really paranoid, you need to do that first
2011-03-05 13:32:41	fsmithred	otherwise, someone can tell what part of the drive has stuff on it and what doesn't
2011-03-05 13:32:47	fsmithred	but they still can't read it
2011-03-05 13:33:50	fsmithred	dd'ing /dev/urandom to a big drive takes forever
2011-03-05 13:34:17	fsmithred	like 24hrs for a 250gb drive
2011-03-05 13:34:26	nadir	mhh... i am rather not so paranoid.
2011-03-05 13:34:35	nadir	but i got a problem
2011-03-05 13:34:43	nadir	I picked /dev/sda1 for root
2011-03-05 13:34:46	nadir	ext4
2011-03-05 13:34:52	fsmithred	with encryption?
2011-03-05 13:34:56	nadir	and /dev/sda2 for /home, also ext4
2011-03-05 13:34:58	nadir	yes,
2011-03-05 13:35:03	nadir	i then picked encrpytion.
2011-03-05 13:35:04	fsmithred	where's /boot?
2011-03-05 13:35:06	nadir	and it dies.
2011-03-05 13:35:13	nadir	i did not pick /boot
2011-03-05 13:35:18	fsmithred	ah, ok
2011-03-05 13:35:22	fsmithred	I need to add another test
2011-03-05 13:35:31	nadir	it says:
2011-03-05 13:35:38	nadir	you need to enter a passphrase
2011-03-05 13:35:46	nadir	exit due to error: 1
2011-03-05 13:35:54	fsmithred	check the error log
2011-03-05 13:36:08	fsmithred	I think it's z8error_log
2011-03-05 13:36:08	nadir	puhh.. you start getting worse than Telemachus...
2011-03-05 13:36:10	nadir	ha ha.
2011-03-05 13:36:19	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 13:36:30	nadir	k, easy:
2011-03-05 13:36:38	nadir	cryptsetup: command not found.
2011-03-05 13:37:52	fsmithred	ah
2011-03-05 13:37:57	nadir	any other dependencies i need to think of?
2011-03-05 13:37:57	fsmithred	yeah, I've added a test for that
2011-03-05 13:38:03	fsmithred	in zinstaller.02
2011-03-05 13:38:08	fsmithred	nope
2011-03-05 13:38:11	fsmithred	install cryptsetup
2011-03-05 13:38:14	nadir	ok. next try.
2011-03-05 13:38:16	fsmithred	then modprobe dm-mod
2011-03-05 13:38:23	nadir	what?
2011-03-05 13:38:35	fsmithred	after you install cryptsetup in the live-cd
2011-03-05 13:38:41	fsmithred	modprobe -v dm-mod
2011-03-05 13:38:47	nadir	i hear you, i only expressed my shock.
2011-03-05 13:39:13	fsmithred	well, I guess the module doesn't get inserted automatically when you install
2011-03-05 13:39:36	nadir	update-initramfs is running, so it might be. i will check.
2011-03-05 13:40:00	nadir	.
2011-03-05 13:40:11	nadir	but you realize that this is getting very high-level?
2011-03-05 13:40:25	nadir	asking for a separate /boot, asking for encryption?
2011-03-05 13:40:30	fsmithred	believe me, the module was not inserted
2011-03-05 13:40:35	nadir	what i mean is: it reall y is cool.
2011-03-05 13:40:41	nadir	i believe you.
2011-03-05 13:41:47	nadir	says: insmod /long/path/dm-mod.ko
2011-03-05 13:42:00	nadir	and yes: it was not loaded on its own.
2011-03-05 13:42:01	fsmithred	sounds right
2011-03-05 13:42:08	nadir	ok, so next run?
2011-03-05 13:43:05	nadir	type uppercase yes, means uppsercase for sure.
2011-03-05 13:43:13	nadir	? I need to do "YES" ?
2011-03-05 13:43:16	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-05 13:43:18	fsmithred	I mean
2011-03-05 13:43:19	nadir	ok
2011-03-05 13:43:20	fsmithred	YES
2011-03-05 13:43:27	nadir	ha. got you.
2011-03-05 13:43:33	fsmithred	that's not my doing
2011-03-05 13:43:42	fsmithred	it's cryptsetup that wants that
2011-03-05 13:44:08	nadir	yes?
2011-03-05 13:44:11	nadir	thats funny.
2011-03-05 13:44:18	nadir	nice trick to make one think.
2011-03-05 13:44:27	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 13:44:42	nadir	but if one does Yes, and does not understand, it might be a pain in the ass too.
2011-03-05 13:44:46	nadir	Yes, do as i say!
2011-03-05 13:44:50	nadir	is one of those.
2011-03-05 13:44:56	nadir	I forgot the !, and what not.
2011-03-05 13:45:17	fsmithred	yeah, I forgot all about that one
2011-03-05 13:45:22	nadir	will it talke long?
2011-03-05 13:45:27	fsmithred	no
2011-03-05 13:45:32	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 13:45:33	fsmithred	rsync takes the longest
2011-03-05 13:46:17	nadir	k.
2011-03-05 13:46:20	nadir	One thing.
2011-03-05 13:46:27	nadir	My laptop is like that:
2011-03-05 13:46:52	nadir	-> / is a 20GB, including /home
2011-03-05 13:47:09	nadir	my data is at /home/markus/data, a separate partition.
2011-03-05 13:47:12	nadir	So:
2011-03-05 13:47:29	nadir	i could move the 20GB /dev/sda1, encrypt it, and move the 20GB back.
2011-03-05 13:47:38	nadir	and so far i should be "save", or not?
2011-03-05 13:47:52	nadir	cause my pics and so don't need to be encrypted,
2011-03-05 13:47:59	nadir	but my ssh-keys and so would sure be nice.
2011-03-05 13:48:30	fsmithred	yeah, I think that would work
2011-03-05 13:48:36	fsmithred	but not using the installer
2011-03-05 13:48:39	nadir	ok, that might be worth a try.
2011-03-05 13:48:59	fsmithred	just rsync the whole filesystem onto the data partition
2011-03-05 13:49:07	fsmithred	um
2011-03-05 13:49:10	fsmithred	boot from cd first
2011-03-05 13:49:17	fsmithred	copy it over
2011-03-05 13:49:31	fsmithred	reformat/encrypt the partition manually
2011-03-05 13:49:35	fsmithred	mount it
2011-03-05 13:49:41	fsmithred	rsync back onto it
2011-03-05 13:49:51	fsmithred	shit
2011-03-05 13:49:52	fsmithred	no
2011-03-05 13:49:58	nadir	how do i reformat/encrypt?
2011-03-05 13:50:00	fsmithred	you still need to make a separate /boot
2011-03-05 13:50:12	fsmithred	is this a new install?
2011-03-05 13:50:18	fsmithred	from a live cd?
2011-03-05 13:50:33	nadir	yes, a new install.
2011-03-05 13:50:38	fsmithred	refracta?
2011-03-05 13:50:42	nadir	but a lot of things are setup already.
2011-03-05 13:50:44	nadir	no, debian.
2011-03-05 13:50:52	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 13:50:56	fsmithred	manually, then
2011-03-05 13:51:08	fsmithred	copy it to data partition as described
2011-03-05 13:51:21	fsmithred	then repartition the 20gb
2011-03-05 13:51:29	fsmithred	make /boot
2011-03-05 13:51:47	fsmithred	100mb should be more than enough, unless you're going to have a big bunch of different kernels
2011-03-05 13:51:54	fsmithred	even 50 would do
2011-03-05 13:51:55	nadir	mhhk.. i already got 3 primary-partitions
2011-03-05 13:52:05	fsmithred	you can have 4
2011-03-05 13:52:14	fsmithred	you could axe the swap if you have one
2011-03-05 13:52:18	fsmithred	and make a swap file
2011-03-05 13:52:25	nadir	yes, got you.
2011-03-05 13:52:42	fsmithred	make /boot ext2
2011-03-05 13:52:50	fsmithred	then to make /
2011-03-05 13:53:04	fsmithred	install cryptsetup and modprobe dm-mod
2011-03-05 13:53:37	fsmithred	sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/? root-fs
2011-03-05 13:53:50	fsmithred	your partitions will end up being out of order
2011-03-05 13:54:04	fsmithred	sudo mount /dev/mapper/root-fs
2011-03-05 13:54:10	fsmithred	oops
2011-03-05 13:54:16	fsmithred	need a mountpoint on that command
2011-03-05 13:54:24	fsmithred	then rsync
2011-03-05 13:54:30	fsmithred	unmount it
2011-03-05 13:54:43	fsmithred	sudo cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/root-fs
2011-03-05 13:54:53	fsmithred	commands are in the script if you want to refer to them
2011-03-05 13:55:29	fsmithred	I guess / will be /dev/sda3 or /dev/sda4, depending on how you repartition
2011-03-05 13:56:05	nadir	root-fs is like a "name" ?
2011-03-05 13:56:10	fsmithred	yes, a label
2011-03-05 13:56:13	fsmithred	not a disk label
2011-03-05 13:56:20	fsmithred	just a temporary label for the mapper
2011-03-05 13:56:30	fsmithred	anything you want
2011-03-05 13:56:31	nadir	so you picked root-fs, but i could call it "this-or-that" ?
2011-03-05 13:56:35	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 13:56:36	fsmithred	yup
2011-03-05 13:56:45	nadir	ok, i wrote that down.
2011-03-05 13:56:53	nadir	I am not very good with gparted.
2011-03-05 13:56:55	fsmithred	there are probably some restrictions on what characters and how many you can use
2011-03-05 13:56:57	nadir	Very easy stuff: ok.
2011-03-05 13:57:12	fsmithred	I'd probably delete /dev/sda1
2011-03-05 13:57:13	nadir	but if it spits out some errors: omg.
2011-03-05 13:57:19	fsmithred	then make /boot and /
2011-03-05 13:57:40	fsmithred	if you try to shrink /
2011-03-05 13:57:45	fsmithred	it'll move the data
2011-03-05 13:58:08	fsmithred	take longer for moving data that's going to get wiped out
2011-03-05 13:58:09	fsmithred	oh
2011-03-05 13:58:12	fsmithred	hehe
2011-03-05 13:58:21	fsmithred	I forgot the last step before rsync
2011-03-05 13:58:28	fsmithred	after you do the luksOpen
2011-03-05 13:58:35	fsmithred	you still need to put a filesystem on it
2011-03-05 13:58:47	fsmithred	mke2fs -j /dev/whatever
2011-03-05 13:58:51	fsmithred	for ext3
2011-03-05 13:58:53	fsmithred	or
2011-03-05 13:59:01	nadir	but gparted works too?
2011-03-05 13:59:03	fsmithred	mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/whatever
2011-03-05 13:59:04	fsmithred	no
2011-03-05 13:59:05	nadir	right click?
2011-03-05 13:59:10	nadir	what?
2011-03-05 13:59:11	fsmithred	gparted don't do encrypted
2011-03-05 13:59:18	nadir	suckers.
2011-03-05 13:59:27	fsmithred	you'll wipe out the fs that gparted makes when you run cryptsetup
2011-03-05 13:59:28	fsmithred	fuck
2011-03-05 13:59:32	fsmithred	I still got it wrong
2011-03-05 13:59:47	fsmithred	cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
2011-03-05 13:59:58	fsmithred	cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX label
2011-03-05 14:00:57	fsmithred	mke2fs -t extN /dev/mapper/label
2011-03-05 14:01:12	fsmithred	mount /dev/mapper/label /some-mountpoint
2011-03-05 14:01:19	fsmithred	rsync
2011-03-05 14:01:30	fsmithred	umount /some-mountpoint
2011-03-05 14:01:40	fsmithred	luksClose /dev/mapper/label
2011-03-05 14:02:01	fsmithred	um
2011-03-05 14:02:07	fsmithred	still forgot a piece
2011-03-05 14:02:11	fsmithred	before you unmount it
2011-03-05 14:02:27	fsmithred	you need to move the contents of /boot to the little partition
2011-03-05 14:02:28	nadir	pray?
2011-03-05 14:02:34	nadir	oh.
2011-03-05 14:02:37	fsmithred	and edit fstab
2011-03-05 14:02:40	fsmithred	shit
2011-03-05 14:02:48	fsmithred	and create /etc/crypttab
2011-03-05 14:03:19	nadir	what?
2011-03-05 14:03:24	fsmithred	mount the little partition
2011-03-05 14:03:42	fsmithred	copy /boot/* to it
2011-03-05 14:03:43	nadir	that part is ok, mount and mv /boot to there.
2011-03-05 14:03:53	nadir	but what the heck is crypttab?
2011-03-05 14:05:04	nadir	mkdir /etc/crypttab ?
2011-03-05 14:05:22	fsmithred	no
2011-03-05 14:05:27	fsmithred	nano /etc/crypttab
2011-03-05 14:05:29	fsmithred	well
2011-03-05 14:05:53	fsmithred	mountpoint/etc/crypttab
2011-03-05 14:06:20	fsmithred	label   /dev/sdX   none   luks
2011-03-05 14:06:56	fsmithred	and fstab should be like this for /
2011-03-05 14:08:14	fsmithred	/dev/mapper/label   /   ext3(or 4)    defaults...blah
2011-03-05 14:08:45	fsmithred	just need to replace the device name or uuid with /dev/mapper/label
2011-03-05 14:09:39	nadir	uhum
2011-03-05 14:09:48	nadir	And the content of /etc/crypttab is:
2011-03-05 14:09:56	nadir	mountpoint/etc/crypttab
2011-03-05 14:10:04	nadir	without any spaces.
2011-03-05 14:10:12	nadir	Only those few words?
2011-03-05 14:10:19	fsmithred	label   /dev/sdX   none   luks
2011-03-05 14:10:25	fsmithred	yeah, tabs between them
2011-03-05 14:10:32	fsmithred	even double-tabs
2011-03-05 14:10:38	nadir	ah.
2011-03-05 14:10:48	nadir	so content of crypttab is:
2011-03-05 14:10:58	nadir	root-fs /dev/sdX none luks
2011-03-05 14:11:01	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-05 14:11:05	nadir	in case i picked ...
2011-03-05 14:11:09	nadir	and taht it all?
2011-03-05 14:11:12	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 14:11:15	nadir	that one line?
2011-03-05 14:11:18	nadir	whew.
2011-03-05 14:11:21	nadir	thanks.
2011-03-05 14:11:24	fsmithred	yw
2011-03-05 14:11:34	fsmithred	fuck
2011-03-05 14:11:44	fsmithred	I keep remembering problems I ran into
2011-03-05 14:11:48	fsmithred	gimme a second to think
2011-03-05 14:12:20	fsmithred	pretty sure you're gonna have to run a few commands that are at the end of the script
2011-03-05 14:12:33	fsmithred	so you can run update-initramfs in chroot
2011-03-05 14:12:42	fsmithred	geez
2011-03-05 14:12:49	fsmithred	this is why people script stuff
2011-03-05 14:12:54	fsmithred	they can't remember all this shit
2011-03-05 14:12:57	nadir	yup.
2011-03-05 14:13:02	nadir	so:
2011-03-05 14:13:14	nadir	refracta-installer spit out anotehr exit 1
2011-03-05 14:13:19	nadir	something about /boot
2011-03-05 14:13:42	fsmithred	you still trying to encrypt / without a /boot?
2011-03-05 14:13:48	nadir	auto-detection on /dev/
2011-03-05 14:13:49	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 14:13:53	fsmithred	won't work
2011-03-05 14:13:57	nadir	and that does not work.
2011-03-05 14:13:59	nadir	Whew.
2011-03-05 14:14:01	nadir	good.
2011-03-05 14:14:01	fsmithred	I added a test so it dies sooner
2011-03-05 14:14:03	nadir	next run.
2011-03-05 14:14:13	fsmithred	you want the newer version?
2011-03-05 14:14:22	fsmithred	zinstaller.02
2011-03-05 14:14:24	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 14:14:28	fsmithred	gimme a minute
2011-03-05 14:14:29	nadir	huh?
2011-03-05 14:14:31	nadir	no z here.
2011-03-05 14:14:33	fsmithred	oh
2011-03-05 14:14:38	nadir	shall i pick z*
2011-03-05 14:14:39	fsmithred	I haven't fixed the text version
2011-03-05 14:14:47	nadir	ah.
2011-03-05 14:14:49	nadir	np.
2011-03-05 14:14:55	nadir	let me check z-installer
2011-03-05 14:16:08	fsmithred	you want direct link?
2011-03-05 14:16:09	nadir	for /boot i pick ext2 and 100 MB ?
2011-03-05 14:16:11	fsmithred	it's up
2011-03-05 14:16:17	fsmithred	yeah, that's good
2011-03-05 14:16:18	nadir	no, i can pull it.
2011-03-05 14:16:21	nadir	ok
2011-03-05 14:16:22	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 14:16:31	nadir	like said: git is cool.
2011-03-05 14:16:36	nadir	makes it very easy.
2011-03-05 14:16:55	nadir	in case it works...
2011-03-05 14:18:30	nadir	fuck the fucking fuck.
2011-03-05 14:18:33	fsmithred	?
2011-03-05 14:18:40	nadir	Now gparted can't delete the luks partitions.
2011-03-05 14:18:45	nadir	grml...
2011-03-05 14:18:55	fsmithred	is it mounted?
2011-03-05 14:19:03	fsmithred	or still open?
2011-03-05 14:19:11	fsmithred	ls /dev/mapper
2011-03-05 14:20:05	nadir	ls /dev/mapper lists them
2011-03-05 14:20:15	nadir	root-fs, home-fs and something else
2011-03-05 14:20:23	nadir	control
2011-03-05 14:21:24	fsmithred	sudo cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/root-fs
2011-03-05 14:21:30	fsmithred	and same for home-fs
2011-03-05 14:21:41	fsmithred	control stays there
2011-03-05 14:21:43	nadir	no sudo here, but i got the idea.
2011-03-05 14:21:54	fsmithred	you're doing this on the laptop?
2011-03-05 14:22:08	nadir	no.
2011-03-05 14:22:12	fsmithred	or just you got a root terminal?
2011-03-05 14:22:15	nadir	in Vbox, to test the installer.
2011-03-05 14:22:18	fsmithred	whew
2011-03-05 14:22:22	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 14:22:38	fsmithred	I keep forgetting that there's a root account in refracta
2011-03-05 14:22:44	fsmithred	my builds don't have that
2011-03-05 14:22:50	nadir	uhum
2011-03-05 14:22:56	nadir	the command tells me it is busy.
2011-03-05 14:23:09	nadir	cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/root-fs
2011-03-05 14:23:13	fsmithred	trying to remember...
2011-03-05 14:23:16	nadir	says: busy
2011-03-05 14:23:19	nadir	i will reboot.
2011-03-05 14:23:23	fsmithred	yeah, I recall that error
2011-03-05 14:23:26	fsmithred	good idea
2011-03-05 14:23:30	fsmithred	that might be what I did
2011-03-05 14:23:45	nadir	the same killed me with lvm
2011-03-05 14:23:48	nadir	too much fiddling
2011-03-05 14:24:00	fsmithred	yeah, lvm is another layer of craziness
2011-03-05 14:24:11	fsmithred	I got a couple of installs with encrypted lvm
2011-03-05 14:24:19	fsmithred	and I'd like to get rid of it
2011-03-05 14:24:27	fsmithred	both are lenny
2011-03-05 14:24:52	fsmithred	only reason I did it was so I could enter one password to unlock it
2011-03-05 14:25:00	fsmithred	instead of one for each encrypted partition
2011-03-05 14:25:08	fsmithred	but I'm gonna try keyfiles
2011-03-05 14:25:13	nadir	you do that during boot?
2011-03-05 14:25:15	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-05 14:25:19	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 14:25:43	fsmithred	without the lvm
2011-03-05 14:25:54	nadir	if AuntMartha will run into encryption she will get an orgasm or a heart-attack.
2011-03-05 14:25:56	fsmithred	have to enter pw for /, /home and swap
2011-03-05 14:25:59	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 14:26:19	fsmithred	yeah, this might have to wait for the geek version of refracta
2011-03-05 14:26:34	nadir	it is pretty cool.
2011-03-05 14:26:40	fsmithred	or we hide it and only tell people who have the secret password where they can find it
2011-03-05 14:26:49	nadir	i like the actual version more and more, btw.
2011-03-05 14:27:01	fsmithred	603?
2011-03-05 14:27:10	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 14:27:15	nadir	since it went blue.
2011-03-05 14:27:21	nadir	nice choice of apps (well: gnome)
2011-03-05 14:27:25	nadir	nice look and feel.
2011-03-05 14:27:34	fsmithred	I haven't used it much
2011-03-05 14:27:39	fsmithred	but it does seem good
2011-03-05 14:27:46	nadir	me neither, but when i use it i like it.
2011-03-05 14:28:29	fsmithred	aunt martha might miss being able to open the pps files her friends send her
2011-03-05 14:28:42	fsmithred	I get a lot of those in email
2011-03-05 14:28:52	fsmithred	slide shows
2011-03-05 14:28:55	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 14:28:58	nadir	That is real shit.
2011-03-05 14:29:04	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 14:29:06	nadir	A friend of mine sends them to me all the time.
2011-03-05 14:29:14	nadir	How crazy is that?
2011-03-05 14:29:30	nadir	I told him several times i am not able to see them.
2011-03-05 14:29:39	nadir	But they get forwarded automatically.
2011-03-05 14:29:44	fsmithred	occasionally they contain nice pics that I want to steal for desktop wallpaper
2011-03-05 14:30:05	fsmithred	but lately, I can't seem to stop the slide show and edit the file to grab the pics
2011-03-05 14:30:28	fsmithred	not sure if it's the file or the newer version of OOo
2011-03-05 14:31:20	nadir	makes sense. But i will not install OO only for that one friend of mine who sends it to me.
2011-03-05 14:31:25	nadir	else i don't use it.
2011-03-05 14:31:38	nadir	(for the only reason that i don't need it, not that i say it is bad or so)
2011-03-05 14:31:58	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 14:32:02	nadir	rebooting did the trick
2011-03-05 14:32:09	nadir	100MB boot is created.
2011-03-05 14:32:11	nadir	lets rock
2011-03-05 14:32:30	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-05 14:32:49	fsmithred	those other commands you need if you're going to encrypt the laptop...
2011-03-05 14:33:21	nadir	globbing works with sftp
2011-03-05 14:33:26	fsmithred	see lines 593, 594, 595, 603, 613 of zinstaller.02
2011-03-05 14:33:47	nadir	yup.
2011-03-05 14:33:49	fsmithred	yeah, tab-complete works with it, too - that's new
2011-03-05 14:34:00	fsmithred	in lenny, you had to type the entire filename
2011-03-05 14:34:10	nadir	puh.
2011-03-05 14:34:15	nadir	i hate that.
2011-03-05 14:34:23	fsmithred	yup
2011-03-05 14:34:26	fsmithred	lots of mistakes
2011-03-05 14:34:31	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 14:35:18	fsmithred	what customizations on the laptop you want to save?
2011-03-05 14:35:23	fsmithred	packages or configs?
2011-03-05 14:35:25	nadir	xfce
2011-03-05 14:35:29	nadir	yup.
2011-03-05 14:35:31	nadir	both.
2011-03-05 14:35:45	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 14:35:48	fsmithred	just in case...
2011-03-05 14:35:51	fsmithred	before you do it
2011-03-05 14:35:53	nadir	right now i am very "busy" with all the things which come with a laptop.
2011-03-05 14:35:56	nadir	like wireless.
2011-03-05 14:36:04	fsmithred	back up /etc, back up home configs
2011-03-05 14:36:13	fsmithred	and run 'get-selections.sh'
2011-03-05 14:36:19	nadir	yes, i will do that too.
2011-03-05 14:36:42	fsmithred	I'm thinking you could just install refracta and then convert it with those things
2011-03-05 14:36:58	fsmithred	I don't know which would be easier or safer
2011-03-05 14:37:06	nadir	modprobe dm-mod ?
2011-03-05 14:37:14	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-05 14:39:21	nadir	with zenity it does not ask for a password, for encryption, correct?
2011-03-05 14:39:59	fsmithred	it'll ask in the terminal
2011-03-05 14:40:10	fsmithred	there's a note in all caps to tell you that
2011-03-05 14:40:12	nadir	yup, i  just realized.
2011-03-05 14:40:20	nadir	But holy jesus and the merry chain.
2011-03-05 14:40:30	nadir	You are a real master of the bash foo now.
2011-03-05 14:40:34	nadir	that is very cool
2011-03-05 14:40:49	nadir	all the zenity stuff.
2011-03-05 14:40:52	nadir	very sexy.
2011-03-05 14:40:54	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 14:41:01	nadir	Especially the summary at the end.
2011-03-05 14:41:11	nadir	before it says: you needa answer a bit in the terminal
2011-03-05 14:41:15	fsmithred	wish I could get the partitions to display in order
2011-03-05 14:41:26	nadir	yup, i see that it bugs you.
2011-03-05 14:41:30	nadir	but: very minor.
2011-03-05 14:41:37	fsmithred	it's worse with two hard drives
2011-03-05 14:41:53	fsmithred	and on my main hard drive, it's not just in reverse order
2011-03-05 14:41:58	fsmithred	it's completely out of order
2011-03-05 14:42:15	fsmithred	someone is sure to screw up
2011-03-05 14:42:45	fsmithred	I should probably ask about that at #bash
2011-03-05 14:42:52	fsmithred	it's the find command that does it
2011-03-05 14:43:21	fsmithred	brb
2011-03-05 14:43:25	nadir	yup
2011-03-05 14:44:06	nadir	wow: progress bar now.
2011-03-05 14:46:15	fsmithred	b
2011-03-05 14:46:45	nadir	ok.
2011-03-05 14:46:53	nadir	i am waiting for success.
2011-03-05 14:47:08	nadir	one thing:
2011-03-05 14:47:17	nadir	i get the progress bar,
2011-03-05 14:47:28	nadir	and in the background the output of the terminal.
2011-03-05 14:47:38	nadir	whick looks a bit like richkids on LSD
2011-03-05 14:47:58	nadir	perhaps redirecting the output of the terminal to /path/wherever ?
2011-03-05 14:48:03	fsmithred	yeah, I had to make rsync verbose to get the progress bar do do anything
2011-03-05 14:48:10	nadir	aha.
2011-03-05 14:48:20	fsmithred	might be a way to fix it
2011-03-05 14:48:20	nadir	for me it is cool, no problems with that.
2011-03-05 14:48:23	nadir	but it is a bit strange.
2011-03-05 14:48:43	nadir	all that are very minor issues.
2011-03-05 14:48:56	nadir	i am amazed.
2011-03-05 14:50:05	fsmithred	the test for /boot partition works
2011-03-05 14:50:10	fsmithred	just tried it
2011-03-05 14:50:47	nadir	good.
2011-03-05 14:50:52	fsmithred	another solution for your laptop
2011-03-05 14:50:55	nadir	If you add the info at forum-refracta
2011-03-05 14:51:07	fsmithred	make a small encrypted partition just for ssh and gpg keys
2011-03-05 14:51:08	nadir	perhaps jheaton wants to hire as a guinea-pig too?
2011-03-05 14:51:24	fsmithred	and symlink ~/.ssh and ~/.gpg to that partition
2011-03-05 14:51:33	nadir	might be an idea.
2011-03-05 14:51:40	fsmithred	yeah, I posted in hopes that he would try it
2011-03-05 14:51:44	fsmithred	or someone
2011-03-05 14:51:49	nadir	but i am slowly moving towards the idea at all. very confusing.
2011-03-05 14:51:54	fsmithred	there are a couple others who come around once in awhile
2011-03-05 14:52:03	nadir	you should add the mini-info about cryptsetup too.
2011-03-05 14:52:06	fsmithred	I figure there are about six people using refracta
2011-03-05 14:52:17	nadir	It is a pity.
2011-03-05 14:52:22	nadir	It really is a nice project.
2011-03-05 14:52:29	nadir	confusing and all, but i like it a lot.
2011-03-05 14:52:34	fsmithred	well, it's not like Dean has publicized it
2011-03-05 14:52:42	nadir	(probably cause all of the chaos)
2011-03-05 14:52:44	nadir	exactly.
2011-03-05 14:52:45	fsmithred	yup
2011-03-05 14:52:48	nadir	He does not mention it.
2011-03-05 14:53:01	fsmithred	once the version settles down
2011-03-05 14:53:02	nadir	and then all the removing of isos, moving forums around
2011-03-05 14:53:09	nadir	it is not easy being a fan-boy.-
2011-03-05 14:53:09	fsmithred	maybe get it posted on distrowatch
2011-03-05 14:53:30	fsmithred	not sure if it really counts as a distro, though
2011-03-05 14:53:39	fsmithred	well
2011-03-05 14:53:44	fsmithred	I guess if lmde counts
2011-03-05 14:53:51	fsmithred	then refracta could, too
2011-03-05 14:54:04	nadir	half-yes, half-no.
2011-03-05 14:54:07	nadir	i am not sure.
2011-03-05 14:54:14	nadir	but it is one of the few i use.
2011-03-05 14:54:58	nadir	debian with e17 is/was very seldom
2011-03-05 14:55:07	nadir	but it also is a bit strange.
2011-03-05 14:55:20	fsmithred	e17 is strange
2011-03-05 14:55:28	fsmithred	I kinda like it and I don't like it
2011-03-05 14:55:30	nadir	i don't think i will go back.
2011-03-05 14:55:34	nadir	yes, what you say.
2011-03-05 14:55:50	nadir	for now i am very happy with xfce.
2011-03-05 14:55:58	nadir	it is easy, it is fast, it is comfortable.
2011-03-05 14:56:04	fsmithred	and not motivated enough to figure out the configs so that I can get it the way I want
2011-03-05 14:56:04	nadir	what more can one want?
2011-03-05 14:56:10	fsmithred	yeah, xfce is great
2011-03-05 14:56:21	fsmithred	Dean would like it if I made a refracta-xfce
2011-03-05 14:56:29	nadir	yes?
2011-03-05 14:56:33	nadir	go for it.
2011-03-05 14:56:37	nadir	that would be cool.
2011-03-05 14:56:38	fsmithred	yeah, he's brought it up a couple of times
2011-03-05 14:56:44	fsmithred	pretty sure I will
2011-03-05 14:56:57	fsmithred	I need to trim down my build
2011-03-05 14:57:09	fsmithred	get it to conform to refracta standards
2011-03-05 14:58:00	fsmithred	change a few of the apps
2011-03-05 14:58:04	fsmithred	shouldn't be difficult
2011-03-05 14:58:30	nadir	what i miss a bit are bookmarks in iceweasel
2011-03-05 14:58:35	nadir	some cool stuff.
2011-03-05 14:58:45	nadir	I like that a lot, if i use a live-CD
2011-03-05 14:59:00	nadir	looking what other people check, or recommend.
2011-03-05 14:59:19	nadir	like pornhub, to give an arbitrary example.
2011-03-05 14:59:21	nadir	:-)
2011-03-05 14:59:28	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 14:59:46	nadir	all the excitement is making be a bit foolish.
2011-03-05 14:59:53	nadir	the new forum, the new laptop...
2011-03-05 15:00:02	nadir	bit too much for an old dog
2011-03-05 15:00:54	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 15:01:26	nadir	and then the worst of all beasts: perl.
2011-03-05 15:01:59	nadir	you are busy with regexes?
2011-03-05 15:02:04	nadir	i am at the very beginning.
2011-03-05 15:02:14	fsmithred	haven't done much this week
2011-03-05 15:02:18	nadir	m{la-la}six
2011-03-05 15:02:19	fsmithred	read about half the chapter
2011-03-05 15:02:29	nadir	uhum.
2011-03-05 15:02:33	fsmithred	I need to make notes for all these regexes
2011-03-05 15:02:43	nadir	I read a few lines, try that, it does not work, and i got to figure out why.
2011-03-05 15:02:56	nadir	but i see that it is a very powerful tool.
2011-03-05 15:02:58	nadir	in perl.
2011-03-05 15:04:31	fsmithred	brb - phone
2011-03-05 15:04:34	nadir	k
2011-03-05 15:24:23	fsmithred	b
2011-03-05 15:24:40	fsmithred	you still awake?
2011-03-05 15:24:44	nadir	k. still no succes, but at least no error.
2011-03-05 15:24:53	nadir	not sure if awake, asleep or dead.
2011-03-05 15:24:56	fsmithred	what ahppened?
2011-03-05 15:25:03	nadir	what?
2011-03-05 15:25:09	nadir	with me or with the installation?
2011-03-05 15:25:15	fsmithred	installer didn't work?
2011-03-05 15:25:59	nadir	no, it only takes long
2011-03-05 15:26:24	nadir	at the end it says something like: "success"
2011-03-05 15:26:35	nadir	that did not come yet. but no error neither.
2011-03-05 15:26:36	fsmithred	you may now boot into the new system
2011-03-05 15:26:41	nadir	yup
2011-03-05 15:26:54	fsmithred	there's a message before that, saying that installation was successful
2011-03-05 15:26:59	fsmithred	but that's for installing grub
2011-03-05 15:27:05	fsmithred	can be confusing
2011-03-05 15:27:11	fsmithred	I had errors after that
2011-03-05 15:27:27	nadir	one thing:
2011-03-05 15:27:28	fsmithred	on update-initramfs
2011-03-05 15:27:38	nadir	you can always add wishes what you would want me to test.
2011-03-05 15:27:53	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 15:27:54	nadir	in general i tend to go for the most easy solution (always)
2011-03-05 15:28:09	nadir	that is not what we want, but it is hard to get rid of that behaviour.
2011-03-05 15:28:11	fsmithred	well, first test you did (and posted) was perfect
2011-03-05 15:28:18	fsmithred	you did exactly what I didn't do
2011-03-05 15:28:23	nadir	lol.
2011-03-05 15:28:26	nadir	ok, so good.
2011-03-05 15:28:49	nadir	btw:
2011-03-05 15:28:57	nadir	you could push your scripts a bit more too.
2011-03-05 15:28:57	fsmithred	I guess best stategy now is to try to make as many mistakes as possible
2011-03-05 15:29:09	nadir	yes. just give me ideas how to.
2011-03-05 15:29:22	fsmithred	well, I already did some of the obvious stuff
2011-03-05 15:29:34	fsmithred	try to pick the same partition for two different filesystems
2011-03-05 15:29:48	fsmithred	try to encrypt / without a boot partition
2011-03-05 15:29:59	fsmithred	that kind of thing
2011-03-05 15:30:14	fsmithred	I probably should test with two virtual hard drives
2011-03-05 15:30:22	fsmithred	and then maybe test on real hardware
2011-03-05 15:30:23	nadir	i will try that too.
2011-03-05 15:30:55	nadir	never added much hard-drives to VBox, but for that purpose i will go through it.
2011-03-05 15:31:06	nadir	i think it is via a click?
2011-03-05 15:31:06	fsmithred	it's not difficult
2011-03-05 15:31:13	fsmithred	right click on the controller
2011-03-05 15:31:38	fsmithred	or there's an add button (no words) right above the window that shows the storage devices
2011-03-05 15:31:56	nadir	in settings?
2011-03-05 15:32:00	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 15:32:01	fsmithred	details
2011-03-05 15:32:03	nadir	yup.
2011-03-05 15:32:06	fsmithred	storage
2011-03-05 15:32:14	nadir	i think i have done it short ago, for the first time ever.
2011-03-05 15:32:19	nadir	was easy, but confusing.
2011-03-05 15:32:21	fsmithred	two little icons with + signs
2011-03-05 15:32:27	fsmithred	one for cd, one for hd
2011-03-05 15:32:39	fsmithred	oh, that's for ide
2011-03-05 15:33:01	nadir	yes, that was confusing. It asked me about such things like ide and so.
2011-03-05 15:33:02	fsmithred	ok, if I click on the sata controller, an icon appears next to it with a +
2011-03-05 15:33:05	nadir	i thought: huh?
2011-03-05 15:33:19	nadir	a second.
2011-03-05 15:33:23	nadir	If i tell you: nine
2011-03-05 15:33:27	nadir	does it say enough?
2011-03-05 15:33:31	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-05 15:33:35	nadir	:-)
2011-03-05 15:34:00	nadir	ok, it says ten too.
2011-03-05 15:34:09	nadir	twelve would be better...
2011-03-05 15:34:09	fsmithred	cool - @ten@
2011-03-05 15:34:13	nadir	yes.
2011-03-05 15:34:14	fsmithred	that's almost the end
2011-03-05 15:34:19	fsmithred	only other part is cleanup
2011-03-05 15:34:23	fsmithred	unmount stuff
2011-03-05 15:34:24	nadir	uhum.
2011-03-05 15:34:33	fsmithred	if you look in the error log
2011-03-05 15:34:42	fsmithred	you might see some grep errors
2011-03-05 15:34:46	fsmithred	can ignore them
2011-03-05 15:35:35	fsmithred	that's from $(df | grep some-non-existent-device)
2011-03-05 15:35:46	nadir	cryptsetup successfull.
2011-03-05 15:35:51	fsmithred	doesn't seem to hurt anything
2011-03-05 15:35:55	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-05 15:36:05	nadir	first time ever i use an encrypted install
2011-03-05 15:36:20	fsmithred	easy, right?
2011-03-05 15:36:26	nadir	puh.
2011-03-05 15:36:30	nadir	I can't say so.
2011-03-05 15:36:34	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-05 15:36:37	nadir	Without your help it would have killed me.
2011-03-05 15:36:42	fsmithred	yeah, I know
2011-03-05 15:36:52	fsmithred	I need to have more instructions somewhere
2011-03-05 15:37:07	nadir	i think yes.
2011-03-05 15:37:12	fsmithred	but probably what I've got now is no harder than doing it with the debian installer
2011-03-05 15:37:19	nadir	If in doubt i would, first of all, add them at refracta-forum.
2011-03-05 15:37:30	nadir	no, it is rather easy.
2011-03-05 15:38:01	nadir	In case someone visits there i will add that the second test ran through with success too.
2011-03-05 15:38:10	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-05 15:38:22	nadir	you should post it at other forums too.
2011-03-05 15:38:25	nadir	It is kick-ass
2011-03-05 15:38:27	nadir	really.
2011-03-05 15:38:37	nadir	tell them to test it.
2011-03-05 15:38:39	nadir	to have at it.
2011-03-05 15:38:52	nadir	and if only as a reminder for cryptsetup.
2011-03-05 15:38:53	fsmithred	I'll post it at duf
2011-03-05 15:38:57	nadir	yup.
2011-03-05 15:39:02	nadir	cool bean
2011-03-05 15:39:07	nadir	i am completely excited.
2011-03-05 15:39:25	fsmithred	hey, cc finally thanked me for something
2011-03-05 15:39:38	nadir	i think you were right.
2011-03-05 15:39:44	fsmithred	I told him how to edit the syslinux boot menu in a live build
2011-03-05 15:39:46	nadir	it could be a problem of language.
2011-03-05 15:39:50	nadir	He is a bit strange.
2011-03-05 15:39:54	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-05 15:40:02	fsmithred	he's been there about five years
2011-03-05 15:40:14	fsmithred	and maybe reading documentation is difficult for him
2011-03-05 15:40:32	nadir	yes, one does not know.
2011-03-05 15:40:34	fsmithred	but I recently found out how to mount a usb-hdd .img file
2011-03-05 15:40:36	nadir	I told him to ask you,
2011-03-05 15:40:41	nadir	at linuxquestions.org.
2011-03-05 15:40:44	fsmithred	oh
2011-03-05 15:40:46	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-05 15:40:54	nadir	a sec later he entered at debianuserforums
2011-03-05 15:41:00	fsmithred	I'm learning more about live-build by trying to answer his questions
2011-03-05 15:41:02	nadir	So he really is looking for answers.
2011-03-05 15:41:19	nadir	I had the feeling he is just teasing people.
2011-03-05 15:41:25	nadir	but it does not seem to be that way.
2011-03-05 15:41:28	fsmithred	I didn't see his post there
2011-03-05 15:41:34	nadir	he did not post.
2011-03-05 15:41:39	fsmithred	oh, ok
2011-03-05 15:41:41	nadir	he made an account, but did not post.
2011-03-05 15:41:51	nadir	perhaps he had problems with the how-to-section.
2011-03-05 15:42:13	fsmithred	like maybe how it looks different every time he comes back?
2011-03-05 15:42:25	nadir	ha ha. yes, perhaps that.
2011-03-05 15:42:53	fsmithred	whoever had the idea to not let people post replies to the howtos is brilliant
2011-03-05 15:44:13	fsmithred	I need to go out to the store
2011-03-05 15:44:34	fsmithred	get cat food before the pet food store closes
2011-03-05 15:44:45	fsmithred	otherwise, I'll get yelled at
2011-03-05 15:44:56	fsmithred	well
2011-03-05 15:45:01	fsmithred	I'll get yelled at anyway
2011-03-05 15:45:40	nadir	wait.
2011-03-05 15:45:42	nadir	one second.
2011-03-05 15:45:46	nadir	http://67.43.13.30/~linkfam/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=59&p=328#p328
2011-03-05 15:45:57	nadir	check that later, and if something is wrong correct it please.
2011-03-05 15:46:22	nadir	ok, thats it.
2011-03-05 15:46:33	nadir	bye then?
2011-03-05 15:46:41	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-05 15:46:42	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-05 15:46:46	fsmithred	yeah, see you tomorrow
2011-03-05 15:46:53	nadir	i got to say thanks, very cool.
2011-03-05 15:46:56	nadir	tomorrow. bye.
2011-03-05 15:46:58	fsmithred	you gonna be up for the next six or eight hours?
2011-03-05 15:47:05	nadir	not sure.
2011-03-05 15:47:13	nadir	right now i am tired as hell, but that might change.
2011-03-05 15:47:22	fsmithred	I'll check later - maybe we can go over some perl
2011-03-05 15:47:28	nadir	if so i will be here.
2011-03-05 15:47:33	fsmithred	I have to do my homework so I don't get the ruler
2011-03-05 15:47:39	nadir	ha.
2011-03-05 15:47:51	fsmithred	see you later
2011-03-05 15:47:56	nadir	yup. bye.

2011-03-13 19:50:33	@telemachus	dbbolton: Hey there
2011-03-13 19:51:08	dbbolton	salve
2011-03-13 19:51:29	@telemachus	How are you?
2011-03-13 19:52:24	dbbolton	pretty relieved because i just finished cleaning my room
2011-03-13 19:52:44	dbbolton	now i have to untidy it systematically over the next few weeks
2011-03-13 19:52:54	dbbolton	how about you 
2011-03-13 20:00:08	@telemachus	I am ok
2011-03-13 20:00:20	@telemachus	Though now that you make me think of it, my apartment is not tidy.
2011-03-13 20:00:21	@telemachus	Damn
2011-03-13 20:00:32	@telemachus	I have a funny Perl story, you will get a kick out of.
2011-03-13 20:01:09	@telemachus	Tonight I discovered that I'm named in the credit's to Chromatic's Modern Perl book. (I didn't really earn it. I sent a handful of comments when he submitted it to Github for responses.)
2011-03-13 20:01:18	@telemachus	The story is my wife's comment, when I showed her.
2011-03-13 20:01:28	@telemachus	She said, "You're in the same list with Larry Wall."
2011-03-13 20:01:34	@telemachus	Thus proving I got a good one.
2011-03-13 20:01:49	@telemachus	</story>
2011-03-13 20:01:59	@telemachus	oh shit
2011-03-13 20:02:04	@telemachus	I wrote "credit's"
2011-03-13 20:02:06	@telemachus	sighs
2011-03-13 20:02:25	@telemachus	In my defense, I will argue that I was typing ahead for "Chromatic's"
2011-03-13 20:03:01	dbbolton	i'm more impressed by the fact that your wife knows who larry wall is 
2011-03-13 20:03:12	@telemachus	that is the point of the story - yeah
2011-03-13 20:03:32	@telemachus	I was surprised actually. One of those things, I never realized she had picked up.
2011-03-13 20:04:54	⇨	nadir (~markus@g224073058.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #study-group
2011-03-13 20:04:56	dbbolton	now if you could just convince her that a Perl Mongers meeting counts as a date
2011-03-13 20:05:22	nadir	hi
2011-03-13 20:05:36	 *	telemachus laughs
2011-03-13 20:05:45	dbbolton	nadir: hey
2011-03-13 20:05:51	@telemachus	dbbolton: I'm not taking her anywhere near other geeks. They'll drool on her.
2011-03-13 20:05:54	@telemachus	nadir: Evening
2011-03-13 20:06:18	@telemachus	How are you
2011-03-13 20:06:54	 *	nadir shouts and complaints about the world in general, encrypted installing in special
2011-03-13 20:07:04	nadir	but i am happy to see the both of you
2011-03-13 20:07:11	@telemachus	nadir: Let me ask you a question - why encrypt it?
2011-03-13 20:07:17	@telemachus	You are not Ahtiga Saraz.
2011-03-13 20:07:19	@telemachus	Relax.
2011-03-13 20:07:26	@telemachus	If they want your data, let them have it.
2011-03-13 20:07:46	nadir	good point
2011-03-13 20:08:03	@telemachus	I worry for him.
2011-03-13 20:08:07	nadir	fsmith ran me into it, with his script it was so easy. I for one failed, and big times
2011-03-13 20:08:12	@telemachus	I think he lives in a police state, but still.
2011-03-13 20:09:14	dbbolton	you could be like rms and just use other people's computers to surf the web
2011-03-13 20:09:32	nadir	i already do that. ha ha ha
2011-03-13 20:09:52	nadir	she is so nice to not even change her routers default password.
2011-03-13 20:10:11	nadir	i guess i should tell her.
2011-03-13 20:10:15	dbbolton	i mean he uses different physical machines
2011-03-13 20:10:26	nadir	ah, ok,  i misunderstood
2011-03-13 20:11:02	@telemachus	dbbolton: I thought he used his weird Lenovo pure free thing.
2011-03-13 20:11:34	dbbolton	yeah but only for wgetting stuff
2011-03-13 20:12:04	dbbolton	a browser is just too risky
2011-03-13 20:12:12	nadir	chance are equal to zero that the one who gets my laptop knows what ext* is
2011-03-13 20:12:14	@telemachus	ah, right
2011-03-13 20:12:16	@telemachus	now I remember
2011-03-13 20:12:22	@telemachus	wget + emacs for the web
2011-03-13 20:12:23	@telemachus	ugh
2011-03-13 20:12:53	@telemachus	I'm curious about encryption as a technology, but have zero practical interest or concern.
2011-03-13 20:12:56	 *	telemachus shrugs
2011-03-13 20:13:02	@telemachus	They can have my shit.
2011-03-13 20:13:11	dbbolton	"Don't get me wrong: Emacs is a great operating system – it lacks a good editor, though." -- Thomer Gil
2011-03-13 20:14:13	nadir	i love that quote, even without knowing emacs at all
2011-03-13 20:14:15	@telemachus	Kids can be so cruel. :)
2011-03-13 20:14:28	@telemachus	nadir: I know emacs just well enough to appreciate it, I think.
2011-03-13 20:14:35	@telemachus	Worst editor ever.
2011-03-13 20:14:48	nadir	i thought it was me.
2011-03-13 20:15:30	dbbolton	i think ^x^vAltMetaShift^Z is way easier than Esc+letter
2011-03-13 20:15:54	@telemachus	nadir: It may still be you ;)
2011-03-13 20:15:57	@telemachus	dbbolton: exactly
2011-03-13 20:16:10	nadir	i got it on my never ending list. For the gnu-factor.
2011-03-13 20:16:16	nadir	and i like the icon.
2011-03-13 20:18:02	@telemachus	nadir: I think that's my new email signature
2011-03-13 20:18:19	@telemachus	"In the battle of Unix editors, Emacs has the better icon."
2011-03-13 20:18:26	nadir	yes. thats good.
2011-03-13 20:18:32	@telemachus	I agree, btw, Vim's icon sucks.
2011-03-13 20:18:47	dbbolton	telemachus: tell me if you think this sounds crazy-- i remember signing up for an account on http://status.net/ 6 or so months ago, but now the microblogging part has moved to indenti.ca and all the old accounts were deleted without warning 
2011-03-13 20:19:16	@telemachus	dbbolton: It doesn't sound crazy to me, but I can't confirm it either.
2011-03-13 20:19:24	@telemachus	I signed up ages ago - no idea where.
2011-03-13 20:19:31	@telemachus	They do _not_ have their act together.
2011-03-13 20:19:42	@telemachus	I can't say how awful the experience there is.
2011-03-13 20:19:59	dbbolton	i tried to sign up on identica but it said my user name was taken. i went to that user's page and it was some guy named dave from the bronx
2011-03-13 20:20:23	@telemachus	Hmm - I don't think I know him. Big city, after all.
2011-03-13 20:20:55	@telemachus	Is there no way to get a reset for your email?
2011-03-13 20:20:58	@telemachus	Man they suck.
2011-03-13 20:21:12	dbbolton	i definitely didn't obscure my indentity that much
2011-03-13 20:21:23	@telemachus	I know a guy who is about to launch "rstatus", a federated micro-blog thing built on Ruby.
2011-03-13 20:21:35	@telemachus	We'll see if it takes off.
2011-03-13 20:21:36	@telemachus	Feh.
2011-03-13 20:21:53	@telemachus	I may just quit the whole Tweet experiment. Go back to just email and irc.
2011-03-13 20:21:54	dbbolton	btw, i use this to improve vim's icon https://github.com/dbbolton/vim-icon-updater
2011-03-13 20:22:38	dbbolton	i occasionally get some useful info out of twitter
2011-03-13 20:23:15	dbbolton	of course the last article i read about the signal-noise ratio said it's outrageous 
2011-03-13 20:23:23	@telemachus	I only have Gvim on OSX, where I use this for the icon http://d.pr/JO6N
2011-03-13 20:25:18	dbbolton	i can't view it in GIMP
2011-03-13 20:26:01	nadir	me neither.
2011-03-13 20:26:06	nadir	its gibberish
2011-03-13 20:26:18	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-13 20:26:26	@telemachus	no doubt steve jobs and rms agreed to that
2011-03-13 20:26:38	@telemachus	it's an icns format
2011-03-13 20:26:41	dbbolton	feh and gwenview failed too
2011-03-13 20:26:42	@telemachus	no idea what the fuck that is
2011-03-13 20:26:45	@telemachus	I'll make it a png
2011-03-13 20:26:46	@telemachus	wait one
2011-03-13 20:27:10	nadir	in the meantime: dbbolton -> zsh-thread, big misunderstanding.
2011-03-13 20:27:31	nadir	something went south, but i should have known that you question was a bit more than that...
2011-03-13 20:28:12	@telemachus	http://cl.ly/5CQg
2011-03-13 20:28:20	@telemachus	There it is
2011-03-13 20:30:01	dbbolton	slick
2011-03-13 20:30:27	@telemachus	Yah, I like it pretty well.
2011-03-13 20:31:02	@telemachus	nadir: Btw, one thing about new forum: forget the tits. Just keep posting other stuff.
2011-03-13 20:31:14	dbbolton	probably looks good with the graphite colorscheme
2011-03-13 20:31:16	@telemachus	Over time, the tits will die down (or not), but they don't much matter, I think.
2011-03-13 20:31:33	nadir	yuo are right. My main headache is not the titts, but pictures in general. The tits make it worse.
2011-03-13 20:31:48	nadir	but are not the main problem. Kids today. Shesh....
2011-03-13 20:31:54	@telemachus	dbbolton: Yup, which is what I use (solid plain graphite for a background).
2011-03-13 20:32:48	@telemachus	dbbolton: I found something you should join. I tweeted/identica'd (?) about it, but no context.
2011-03-13 20:32:56	dbbolton	phenona?
2011-03-13 20:33:35	dbbolton	nadir: i've read most of the 350+ page zsh user guide and there are still zillions of things i don't know about it

2011-03-13 20:34:26	@telemachus	I'm very psyched.
2011-03-13 20:34:47	@telemachus	I want to write a little webapp in Dancer.
2011-03-13 20:35:21	@telemachus	Did you hear it from me or somewhere else?
2011-03-13 20:35:33	@telemachus	I got that from Twitter actually - Chromatic's feed.
2011-03-13 20:35:59	dbbolton	from your twitter
2011-03-13 20:36:08	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-13 20:36:26	dbbolton	i think i'll probably keep messing around with mojo
2011-03-13 20:36:52	@telemachus	Yup - you should be able to host it there easily (I hope).
2011-03-13 20:37:52	@telemachus	nadir: Also, fuck www-debian. Just fuck them.
2011-03-13 20:38:22	nadir	dry or with vaseline ?
2011-03-13 20:38:30	@telemachus	urgh
2011-03-13 20:38:54	dbbolton	speaking of which, the shawshank redemption was on amc the other day
2011-03-13 20:39:02	nadir	the funny thing was to find a mailing-list by a search, go there and find links to threads by me.
2011-03-13 20:39:25	@telemachus	My dearest hope is that they end up removing Debian Forums from www.debian.org. Bite off their nose to spite their face.

2011-03-13 20:43:30	@telemachus	And change the channel permissions - that's how I once locked dbbolton out accidentally.

2011-03-16 19:45:08	nadir	next ping
2011-03-16 19:45:32	nadir	well: i can also talk a bit to myself:
2011-03-16 19:45:55	nadir	i downloaded perlbrew, and installed it. I removed the non-hidden perlbrew.
2011-03-16 19:46:23	nadir	That means i got: .perl5 and .perlbrew in my $HOME
2011-03-16 19:46:46	nadir	so i borked it and want to re-install. Can i use those hidden folders, or do i need to start from scratch.
2011-03-16 19:46:58	nadir	i always miss the question mark, here it is: ?
2011-03-16 19:51:21	@telemachus	hey nadir
2011-03-16 19:51:30	nadir	ha.
2011-03-16 19:51:35	nadir	and hi too.
2011-03-16 19:51:49	@telemachus	ok, tell me again the situation, please?
2011-03-16 19:52:29	nadir	i borked my installation.
2011-03-16 19:52:35	@telemachus	yes, that I got
2011-03-16 19:52:36	@telemachus	:)
2011-03-16 19:52:40	@telemachus	More details please
2011-03-16 19:52:42	@telemachus	How borked?
2011-03-16 19:52:56	nadir	no, my OS-install, give me a sec.
2011-03-16 19:53:03	nadir	so i saved all hidden configs
2011-03-16 19:53:14	nadir	.perl5 and .perlbrew were among tehm
2011-03-16 19:53:22	@telemachus	ahhh
2011-03-16 19:53:27	nadir	after re-installation i wanted to install perl again.
2011-03-16 19:53:30	@telemachus	I see
2011-03-16 19:53:32	@telemachus	hmm
2011-03-16 19:53:33	nadir	but i had no per...
2011-03-16 19:53:37	@telemachus	it might work if you put it back
2011-03-16 19:53:40	nadir	i solved it by doing it all again.
2011-03-16 19:53:45	@telemachus	but probably it's better to reinstall frankly
2011-03-16 19:53:47	nadir	no, it did not work.
2011-03-16 19:53:49	@telemachus	I know the Perl build is slow
2011-03-16 19:53:50	nadir	yes?
2011-03-16 19:53:51	@telemachus	but...
2011-03-16 19:53:53	@telemachus	hm?
2011-03-16 19:54:06	nadir	i am only asking for the "proper" way.
2011-03-16 19:54:09	@telemachus	oh, so it's solved?
2011-03-16 19:54:15	@telemachus	for installing Perlbrew?
2011-03-16 19:54:22	nadir	i did the whole thing again.
2011-03-16 19:54:30	@telemachus	It's in the gist for week 1, I believe
2011-03-16 19:54:30	nadir	went to your gisthub, and followed the steps.
2011-03-16 19:54:33	@telemachus	right
2011-03-16 19:54:40	@telemachus	didn't work?
2011-03-16 19:54:43	nadir	but i got those lots of MB in my home,
2011-03-16 19:54:59	nadir	and thought: ain't there a more easy way?
2011-03-16 19:55:13	nadir	not a real problem, more a question about "how" does perlbrew work.
2011-03-16 19:55:35	@telemachus	ahhh
2011-03-16 19:55:39	dbbolton	points the script to a different interpreter
2011-03-16 19:55:39	@telemachus	ok, I can explain
2011-03-16 19:55:57	@telemachus	in a nutshell, it creates one or more folders with specific perl installations
2011-03-16 19:56:04	@telemachus	and then changes your path
2011-03-16 19:56:12	@telemachus	so that it points to exactly the perl you want to be using
2011-03-16 19:56:29	@telemachus	you *could* do it yourself, but nowhere near as reliably
2011-03-16 19:56:32	@telemachus	or easily
2011-03-16 19:56:34	@telemachus	or quickly
2011-03-16 19:56:44	nadir	so "perlbrew" non-hidden is a script?
2011-03-16 19:56:46	@telemachus	the MB in your $HOME are partly the source for each perl
2011-03-16 19:57:01	@telemachus	you could clean up the source if you needed the space
2011-03-16 19:57:10	@telemachus	what do you mean by "perlbrew" non-hidden?
2011-03-16 19:57:20	@telemachus	perlbrew itself, the program, is a perl script, yes
2011-03-16 19:57:32	nadir	i got two hidden perls: .perl5 and .perlbrew.
2011-03-16 19:57:48	nadir	what i downloaded was non-hidden (without dot): perlbrew.
2011-03-16 19:57:56	@telemachus	nadir: Ok, right
2011-03-16 19:57:56	dbbolton	it should be a shell function if it's installed correctly
2011-03-16 19:58:04	@telemachus	one thing at a time
2011-03-16 19:58:15	@telemachus	the perlbrew you downloaded is a bootstrapper
2011-03-16 19:58:16	@telemachus	an installer
2011-03-16 19:58:19	@telemachus	you can delete it
2011-03-16 19:58:21	@telemachus	the one file
2011-03-16 19:59:04	@telemachus	and yeah dbbolton is right, the actual command 'perlbrew' is a function - a shell thing
2011-03-16 19:59:16	@telemachus	the folder .perl5 is where perlbrew stores stuff
2011-03-16 19:59:30	@telemachus	downloaded tarballs, source, builds, modules, docs, etc.
2011-03-16 19:59:33	@telemachus	it can get big
2011-03-16 20:00:01	@telemachus	.perlbrew is a small directory that perlbrew uses for only one thing - an init file
2011-03-16 20:00:11	@telemachus	I'm not sure if you could remove it, but it's not very big either way
2011-03-16 20:00:25	@telemachus	the only big thing is .perl5
2011-03-16 20:00:42	@telemachus	mine is 251MB
2011-03-16 20:00:48	nadir	next time i will save the non-hidden perlbrew...
2011-03-16 20:00:55	nadir	the one i first downloaded
2011-03-16 20:01:00	@telemachus	to read it?
2011-03-16 20:01:09	nadir	no, to rerun it in case i must.
2011-03-16 20:01:21	nadir	reading it is a good idea too.
2011-03-16 20:01:23	nadir	:-)
2011-03-16 20:01:24	@telemachus	ah - it's so small, probably easier to download it again
2011-03-16 20:01:30	@telemachus	it updates medium-often
2011-03-16 20:01:40	nadir	what is the first command?
2011-03-16 20:01:44	nadir	after download.
2011-03-16 20:02:18	nadir	it feels strange to have got 229 MB and no way to set it up again.
2011-03-16 20:02:18	@telemachus	after download, I do chmod +x perlbrew
2011-03-16 20:02:22	@telemachus	then ./perlbrew install
2011-03-16 20:02:26	@telemachus	?
2011-03-16 20:02:30	@telemachus	btw, hi dbbolton
2011-03-16 20:02:30	nadir	yes, that one.
2011-03-16 20:02:33	nadir	yes, hi.
2011-03-16 20:02:36	nadir	and thanks.
2011-03-16 20:04:17	@telemachus	So, does that all make sense about Perlbrew?
2011-03-16 20:04:23	nadir	a bit.
2011-03-16 20:04:28	nadir	more than before.
2011-03-16 20:05:04	nadir	and if i do: use 5.012_003
2011-03-16 20:05:11	nadir	i use a perl which is in my home?
2011-03-16 20:05:26	nadir	$HOME/.perl5/long-way-to-go
2011-03-16 20:05:27	nadir	?
2011-03-16 20:05:33	dbbolton	hi
2011-03-16 20:05:44	dbbolton	perlbrew switch perl-5.12.3
2011-03-16 20:05:47	@telemachus	no, not exactly
2011-03-16 20:05:59	@telemachus	as dbbolton says, perlbrew switch changes your PATH
2011-03-16 20:06:02	 *	nadir shouts and complains in the background...
2011-03-16 20:06:07	@telemachus	so that 5.12.3 gets found first
2011-03-16 20:06:17	nadir	but where is it stored?
2011-03-16 20:06:25	@telemachus	the use 5.013_003; command is internal to Perl itself
2011-03-16 20:06:32	@telemachus	it doesn't cause that perl to be found
2011-03-16 20:06:35	@telemachus	wait
2011-03-16 20:06:39	nadir	/home/m1arkust/.perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.12.3/bin/perl
2011-03-16 20:06:40	@telemachus	one thing at a time, lol, k?
2011-03-16 20:06:44	nadir	ok. sorry.
2011-03-16 20:06:47	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-16 20:06:57	@telemachus	ok, do you have a computer with perlbrew installed?
2011-03-16 20:07:10	nadir	i do it first of all, at least on hard-disk installations.
2011-03-16 20:07:15	nadir	well: after vim.
2011-03-16 20:07:19	@telemachus	right
2011-03-16 20:07:28	@telemachus	so do me a favor, open another terminal
2011-03-16 20:07:34	nadir	k
2011-03-16 20:07:35	@telemachus	and enter "perlbrew switch system"
2011-03-16 20:07:48	@telemachus	then "echo $PATH"
2011-03-16 20:07:57	nadir	another tab is suffiicient, right?
2011-03-16 20:08:01	@telemachus	sure
2011-03-16 20:08:09	@telemachus	sorry, I lied
2011-03-16 20:08:13	@telemachus	"perlbrew off"
2011-03-16 20:08:18	@telemachus	then 'echo $PATH'
2011-03-16 20:08:54	nadir	mhh... it is still there...
2011-03-16 20:09:01	@telemachus	no, it's not
2011-03-16 20:09:04	@telemachus	the bin is still there
2011-03-16 20:09:08	@telemachus	for perlbrew itself
2011-03-16 20:09:10	@telemachus	not the perl
2011-03-16 20:09:28	@telemachus	now do 'perlbrew switch perl-5.12.3'
2011-03-16 20:09:33	@telemachus	then again 'echo $PATH'
2011-03-16 20:09:39	@telemachus	you'll see the difference right away
2011-03-16 20:10:26	nadir	oh.
2011-03-16 20:10:27	nadir	yes.
2011-03-16 20:10:46	@telemachus	that's what perlbrew does really - the most important thing
2011-03-16 20:10:49	nadir	but perlbrew switch system seems to have swallowed it too (to avoid chomp)
2011-03-16 20:10:57	@telemachus	hmm?
2011-03-16 20:11:05	nadir	above you said:
2011-03-16 20:11:22	nadir	do: perlbrew switch system , , , and then echo $SHELL
2011-03-16 20:11:29	nadir	here is the output of that:
2011-03-16 20:11:34	@telemachus	$PATH, not shell
2011-03-16 20:11:40	@telemachus	but ok
2011-03-16 20:11:47	nadir	yes, error, but i meant the right thing:
2011-03-16 20:11:50	nadir	$ echo $PATH
2011-03-16 20:11:51	nadir	/home/m1arkust/.perl5/perlbrew/bin:/home/m1arkust/bin:/opt/e17/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games
2011-03-16 20:11:59	nadir	See: it made it go away too.
2011-03-16 20:12:06	nadir	not that it would mean much to me.
2011-03-16 20:12:23	@telemachus	right
2011-03-16 20:12:28	@telemachus	yes
2011-03-16 20:12:33	@telemachus	it should make it go away
2011-03-16 20:12:52	@telemachus	switch system means "go back to the system's default perl, not a perlbrew perl"
2011-03-16 20:13:07	@telemachus	I could have left it at that, and not done perlbrew off
2011-03-16 20:13:08	@telemachus	sorry
2011-03-16 20:13:22	nadir	np.
2011-03-16 20:14:00	nadir	ok, so i can switch perl-perlbrew on and off.
2011-03-16 20:14:03	@telemachus	so in a nutshell perlbrew (1) helps to make it easier to install multiple perl interpreters and then (2) switch between them easily
2011-03-16 20:14:05	dbbolton	why did you install e17 in opt
2011-03-16 20:14:06	@telemachus	yup
2011-03-16 20:14:22	nadir	dbbolton, that is the way it is if you do it with easy_e17.sh
2011-03-16 20:14:28	@telemachus	can I got back to one other thing?
2011-03-16 20:14:31	nadir	sure
2011-03-16 20:15:04	@telemachus	you asked about "use 5.012_003;"
2011-03-16 20:15:25	@telemachus	It makes sense that you might think "oh, that line tells the script what perl to use"
2011-03-16 20:15:31	@telemachus	But it's not quite true.
2011-03-16 20:15:49	@telemachus	The first line "#!/usr/bin/env perl" does that - in a roundabout way.
2011-03-16 20:16:08	@telemachus	It says "use the "env" program to find the first perl interpreter in my $PATH"
2011-03-16 20:16:35	nadir	got that.
2011-03-16 20:16:40	dbbolton	perldoc was suspiciously quiet when i tried to find out exactly what 'use VERSION' implied for different releases.
2011-03-16 20:16:42	nadir	as far as possible.
2011-03-16 20:16:55	@telemachus	what the "use 5.012_003;" bit does is say this: "Try to use all the features that are in perl 5.12.3. If those features are not available for the perl I'm running on, bail out now."
2011-03-16 20:17:10	nadir	uhum.
2011-03-16 20:17:19	@telemachus	It's a way of (1) turning on features and (2) making sure that people with an older version of Perl don't even try to run your program.
2011-03-16 20:17:22	nadir	bail out means: stop the script and complain?
2011-03-16 20:17:23	@telemachus	WHich wouldn't work for them.
2011-03-16 20:17:28	@telemachus	nadir: Bingo
2011-03-16 20:17:33	nadir	ok.
2011-03-16 20:17:40	nadir	is it called: pragma?
2011-03-16 20:17:43	@telemachus	dbbolton: Hmm - I found some good notes on some of that, but now I'm not sure where
2011-03-16 20:17:49	@telemachus	nadir: yes, also bingo
2011-03-16 20:18:03	@telemachus	it's a pragma
2011-03-16 20:19:41	@telemachus	dbbolton: Is this where you looked? http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/use.html
2011-03-16 20:20:08	dbbolton	telemachus: i looked in a lot of places
2011-03-16 20:20:22	@telemachus	And I take it back. "use" appears to be classified as a function, not a pragma.
2011-03-16 20:20:27	@telemachus	Shows what I know.
2011-03-16 20:21:42	nadir	the actual book i read says the same, so i guess that error is ok
2011-03-16 20:21:49	nadir	(if it is one at all)
2011-03-16 20:22:13	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-16 20:22:15	nadir	perhaps use is a function, but what is tells to use is the pragma? (and perhaps not)
2011-03-16 20:22:37	nadir	use -> function; strict -> pragma.
2011-03-16 20:22:49	@telemachus	nadir: Yes, I think that's right
2011-03-16 20:22:56	nadir	damn, am i good.
2011-03-16 20:22:58	nadir	lol
2011-03-16 20:23:00	@telemachus	you am
2011-03-16 20:23:15	@telemachus	You are liking the "new" old book more?
2011-03-16 20:23:24	nadir	for me the new book is so much better.
2011-03-16 20:23:34	@telemachus	awesome
2011-03-16 20:23:36	@telemachus	I'm glad
2011-03-16 20:23:40	nadir	I read a chapter in the old one for several times: no idea what he speaks of.
2011-03-16 20:23:46	nadir	the new one: i read it and understand.
2011-03-16 20:24:13	nadir	best of all: it is fun.
2011-03-16 20:24:23	nadir	today i awoke and thougth: great, wee bit of perl.
2011-03-16 20:25:04	dbbolton	i think that every hour of every day
2011-03-16 20:25:11	nadir	lol
2011-03-16 20:25:15	nadir	i thought so.
2011-03-16 20:25:54	nadir	Gregor Herman is your boths friend or your both enemy?
2011-03-16 20:26:03	@telemachus	what is a Gregor Herman?
2011-03-16 20:26:17	nadir	ah, i thought he was famous.
2011-03-16 20:26:24	@telemachus	he may be
2011-03-16 20:26:26	@telemachus	just not to me

2011-03-16 20:26:49	dbbolton	i don't really keep up with debian-women
2011-03-16 20:27:10	nadir	i like the tutorials as an easy ways to get some info.
2011-03-16 20:27:20	dbbolton	i'm more into mandriva-women
2011-03-16 20:27:27	dbbolton	they're way easier
2011-03-16 20:27:35	nadir	ah... bigger ...you know what?

2011-03-16 20:31:16	@telemachus	urgh
2011-03-16 20:31:35	@telemachus	Did everyone else just see &#39 instead of ' ?
2011-03-16 20:31:44	nadir	to sum it up: the debian women are sexy like shit, but they also do a good job
2011-03-16 20:31:52	nadir	yes, i saw what you said.

2011-03-16 20:34:16	@telemachus	I'm taking a poll. Nadir likes it.
2011-03-16 20:34:24	nadir	why? cause they are sexy or cause they do a good job or cause of milk cans?
2011-03-16 20:34:36	dbbolton	nadir: milk cans
2011-03-16 20:34:40	nadir	ah.
2011-03-16 20:34:46	nadir	i think we say so.
2011-03-16 20:34:51	nadir	not sure.

2011-03-16 20:36:10	nadir	can i hammer out a last perl question (about versin 5.12.3) ?
2011-03-16 20:36:28	nadir	Hängetitten is rather not friendly.
2011-03-16 20:36:38	dbbolton	i find it hilarious
2011-03-16 20:37:06	@telemachus	dbbolton: I think it's one of those things: only hilarious if you don't have a set.
2011-03-16 20:37:07	nadir	i try to give the female part of me a chance.
2011-03-16 20:37:18	nadir	the child in me failed, so i start a new project.
2011-03-16 20:37:41	nadir	so: vim does autocomplete words i already used.
2011-03-16 20:37:44	dbbolton	telemachus: agreed
2011-03-16 20:37:45	nadir	that is a good thing.
2011-03-16 20:37:52	nadir	but with version 5.12.3
2011-03-16 20:38:05	nadir	it searches for all kind of words i have never heard of before.
2011-03-16 20:38:09	nadir	I get a very long list.
2011-03-16 20:38:14	fsmithred	telemachus, yes, I'm on hashes
2011-03-16 20:38:23	nadir	what is that? and how can i make it: not happen.
2011-03-16 20:38:27	@telemachus	fsmithred: Awesome
2011-03-16 20:38:36	@telemachus	nadir: Turn off autocompletion?
2011-03-16 20:38:49	nadir	i want it for the words in my script. but not for all.
2011-03-16 20:39:00	nadir	if i don't add; use 5.012_003
2011-03-16 20:39:04	nadir	it works like always.
2011-03-16 20:39:16	@telemachus	I never use autocompletion in perl, so I'm honestly not sure how to shut it up in that case.
2011-03-16 20:39:26	nadir	ok
2011-03-16 20:39:27	@telemachus	I guess maybe add the "use 5.012_003;" last?
2011-03-16 20:39:28	nadir	np
2011-03-16 20:39:40	@telemachus	write the whole script, then add that?
2011-03-16 20:39:43	@telemachus	Sort of a copout
2011-03-16 20:39:50	nadir	autocompletion is a little helper, but not necessary for me.
2011-03-16 20:40:04	dbbolton	i never use it
2011-03-16 20:40:14	nadir	it saves a bit of time.
2011-03-16 20:40:22	nadir	and it avoids typos.
2011-03-16 20:40:33	@telemachus	I dislike type-ahead things in general. It freaks me out. Just a personal preference though. I know many programmers swear by it.
2011-03-16 20:40:47	@telemachus	nadir: What key combo do you use for auto-complete?
2011-03-16 20:40:55	nadir	ctrl + n
2011-03-16 20:41:02	@telemachus	As I recall in Perl there are more and less agressive ways to get auto-complete
2011-03-16 20:41:25	nadir	the 12.3 version seems to use the more agressive way.
2011-03-16 20:41:27	fsmithred	oh, are you guys planning to meet saturday or sunday?
2011-03-16 20:41:37	nadir	it seems to go through all comands of the OS.
2011-03-16 20:41:39	fsmithred	I've got a class saturday morning, 10-12
2011-03-16 20:42:42	dbbolton	yuck
2011-03-16 20:42:57	fsmithred	lol, I'm the teacher
2011-03-16 20:42:59	@telemachus	fsmithred: Oh, shit, right. We said Saturday, but is Sunday better nwo?
2011-03-16 20:43:08	fsmithred	yeah, sunday better for me
2011-03-16 20:43:08	@telemachus	s/nwo/now/
2011-03-16 20:43:21	fsmithred	(gives me an extra day to do the homework, too)
2011-03-16 20:44:13	nadir	for me any time and any day is ok, i think i already said so...
2011-03-16 20:44:38	@telemachus	ok, well, fsmithred here's the good news. I fucked up and wrote Sunday anyhow.
2011-03-16 20:44:41	@telemachus	So it's all good.
2011-03-16 20:44:53	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-16 20:45:00	fsmithred	so, what time?
2011-03-16 20:45:40	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/873410 Gist says 16:00 UTC
2011-03-16 20:45:46	@telemachus	So let's go with that.
2011-03-16 20:45:49	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-16 20:45:59	nadir	what time is that for me?
2011-03-16 20:46:19	fsmithred	17:00

2011-03-16 20:47:35	@telemachus	Ah, ok
2011-03-16 20:47:50	fsmithred	do you guys change your clocks in the summer?
2011-03-16 20:47:51	@telemachus	It's 1:00pm for me.
2011-03-16 20:47:57	nadir	yes.
2011-03-16 20:47:58	@telemachus	No, I lie.
2011-03-16 20:48:02	@telemachus	It's 12:00pm
2011-03-16 20:48:04	@telemachus	sighs
2011-03-16 20:48:11	@telemachus	fucking clock will be the death of us
2011-03-16 20:48:21	nadir	i got two times: a) i am awake b) i am asleep.
2011-03-16 20:48:23	fsmithred	telemachus, we're utc - 4 now
2011-03-16 20:48:25	@telemachus	we need to do rock-paper-scissors and two of us move
2011-03-16 20:48:43	@telemachus	fsmithred: yeah, still catching up on that
2011-03-16 20:48:58	fsmithred	I went the other direction
2011-03-16 20:49:04	fsmithred	I was up until 3am
2011-03-16 20:49:04	@telemachus	fsmithred: What time zone are you again?
2011-03-16 20:49:11	fsmithred	eastern
2011-03-16 20:49:14	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-03-16 20:49:15	fsmithred	near boston
2011-03-16 20:49:24	@telemachus	oh, right, it's trav that's in detroit
2011-03-16 20:49:29	@telemachus	half thought that was you
2011-03-16 20:49:53	@telemachus	ok, so nadir - you're moving
2011-03-16 20:49:59	@telemachus	me and him are in the same time zone
2011-03-16 20:50:00	@telemachus	we win
2011-03-16 20:50:01	@telemachus	you move
2011-03-16 20:50:05	@telemachus	also dbbolton
2011-03-16 20:50:09	nadir	you need a sleeper in USA?
2011-03-16 20:50:10	@telemachus	three on 1
2011-03-16 20:50:11	dbbolton	i'm en EDT
2011-03-16 20:50:19	nadir	i am good at sleeping...
2011-03-16 20:50:27	dbbolton	in EDT
2011-03-16 20:50:35	@telemachus	long as you're not muslim, you can probably get a visa here
2011-03-16 20:50:36	@telemachus	np
2011-03-16 20:50:36	dbbolton	i switch to spanish mid sentence
2011-03-16 20:50:43	@telemachus	If you're muslim, lie
2011-03-16 20:50:54	@telemachus	dbbolton: spanglish?
2011-03-16 20:51:20	dbbolton	english 'in' = spanish 'en' 
2011-03-16 20:51:42	@telemachus	yup
2011-03-16 20:51:43	dbbolton	it was actually a weird typo. i was thinking about the 'e' in EDT
2011-03-16 20:51:50	@telemachus	type-ahead
2011-03-16 20:52:17	@telemachus	I make that kind of typo a lot - one letter from a future word.
2011-03-16 20:53:28	fsmithred	me too
2011-03-16 20:53:36	fsmithred	we need to slow down
2011-03-16 20:53:59	fsmithred	nadir, you've got me hooked on the idea of a big /boot partition
2011-03-16 20:54:11	nadir	yes. its good.
2011-03-16 20:54:20	fsmithred	I'm about to do an install, and I think I'm going to go with 2GB or a little bigger
2011-03-16 20:54:26	@telemachus	I like big boots and I cannot lie?
2011-03-16 20:54:28	nadir	i already added grml.iso, but, the bad news: it comes with zsh, which is above me.
2011-03-16 20:54:29	@telemachus	sighs
2011-03-16 20:54:39	dbbolton	my handwriting usually includes letters from previous words, future words, words that i'm thinking about and have no intention of writing, and random spaces
2011-03-16 20:54:52	fsmithred	I copied the live folder from my live-squeeze to the old boot (after resizing it)
2011-03-16 20:54:56	@telemachus	nadir: autocompletion is a nightmare http://cl.ly/5HpH
2011-03-16 20:54:59	fsmithred	and I can boot into the live system
2011-03-16 20:55:05	@telemachus	match 1 of 7511!
2011-03-16 20:55:07	nadir	dbbolton, if i chroot from a zsh-shell to a bash-shell, how would i do that?
2011-03-16 20:55:09	@telemachus	holy shit
2011-03-16 20:55:18	nadir	that is what i am saying.
2011-03-16 20:55:28	nadir	it is more annoying than a help
2011-03-16 20:55:45	nadir	turn of 5.12.3, and you will see that it can be useful.
2011-03-16 20:55:56	dbbolton	nadir: use your target shell as the command arg?
2011-03-16 20:56:07	nadir	yes, but how?
2011-03-16 20:56:13	nadir	i get an error.
2011-03-16 20:56:28	@telemachus	nadir: I'm asking in #vim
2011-03-16 20:56:35	nadir	cool
2011-03-16 20:56:58	dbbolton	nadir: chroot --user=me:me /path /bin/bash ?
2011-03-16 20:57:13	nadir	whew... that is not easy to remember.
2011-03-16 20:57:40	fsmithred	alias it?
2011-03-16 20:57:46	nadir	it is not that i chroot every other day.
2011-03-16 20:58:03	dbbolton	you might not need the --user arg if you're root or staying the same user
2011-03-16 20:58:23	nadir	and what is /path? literally ?
2011-03-16 20:58:38	nadir	chroot /path /usr/bin/bash ?
2011-03-16 20:58:38	dbbolton	nadir: the root that you're changing to
2011-03-16 20:58:46	nadir	ah, i see.
2011-03-16 20:58:58	dbbolton	probably a mount point
2011-03-16 20:58:58	nadir	chroot /media/disk /bin/bash?
2011-03-16 20:59:04	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-16 20:59:04	nadir	the would be easy to remember.
2011-03-16 20:59:17	nadir	simply add it to the end.
2011-03-16 20:59:35	nadir	thanks, will try that later.
2011-03-16 20:59:43	dbbolton	what are you working on
2011-03-16 20:59:57	nadir	i tried encrypted installation.
2011-03-16 21:00:01	nadir	grub got borked
2011-03-16 21:00:15	nadir	i wanted to repair it from a grml.iso via chroot.
2011-03-16 21:00:24	nadir	then i ran into zsh, then i had to give up
2011-03-16 21:00:33	nadir	and use a live-CD
2011-03-16 21:00:54	dbbolton	why was zsh an issue?
2011-03-16 21:01:10	nadir	i did: "chroot /media/disk" and it complained.
2011-03-16 21:01:14	dbbolton	couldn't you just switch back to bash as that user?
2011-03-16 21:01:14	nadir	not sure what exactly.
2011-03-16 21:01:19	nadir	no.
2011-03-16 21:01:22	nadir	i tried that.
2011-03-16 21:01:28	dbbolton	oh
2011-03-16 21:01:40	nadir	but: i don'T switch my SHELL twice a day. So it was _me_.
2011-03-16 21:01:40	dbbolton	it might try to start your login shell by default
2011-03-16 21:02:01	nadir	I only use bash for lazy reasons.
2011-03-16 21:02:08	nadir	it is there, i know it. thats all
2011-03-16 21:02:30	dbbolton	at least you don't use csh. YUCK
2011-03-16 21:02:41	nadir	tell me about it.
2011-03-16 21:02:48	nadir	that really killed me.
2011-03-16 21:03:17	dbbolton	have you tested xfce4.8?
2011-03-16 21:03:23	nadir	yes.
2011-03-16 21:03:28	nadir	from hadret.
2011-03-16 21:04:12	dbbolton	it's in experimental now
2011-03-16 21:04:30	nadir	did you try?
2011-03-16 21:05:20	dbbolton	i'm installing it
2011-03-16 21:05:53	nadir	i for one see an environment or a window-manager as a tool which opens windows.
2011-03-16 21:05:55	fsmithred	I've got hadret's version, too
2011-03-16 21:05:59	fsmithred	but haven't used it much
2011-03-16 21:06:03	nadir	so i for one don't see much of a difference.
2011-03-16 21:06:15	nadir	some tiny changes, but nothing which is of matter for me.
2011-03-16 21:06:27	fsmithred	yeah, I didn't notice any difference
2011-03-16 21:06:51	fsmithred	thinking of upgrading that sid install to wheezy
2011-03-16 21:07:09	nadir	btw: fsmithred: we shall talk about the bad news, if yes: here or in private?
2011-03-16 21:07:14	fsmithred	4.8 should still work, right?
2011-03-16 21:07:24	nadir	bad news about refracta, to be less vague.
2011-03-16 21:07:26	fsmithred	probably in pm
2011-03-16 21:07:42	nadir	i opened a private talk, but you don't seem to see it.
2011-03-16 21:09:02	dbbolton	i think i'm just going to stick with 4.6 because upgrading requires removing some plugins that i use
2011-03-16 21:09:46	nadir	same here. i will go the usual upgrade path.
2011-03-16 21:09:54	nadir	wait till it slips in.
2011-03-16 21:10:38	dbbolton	!memo telemachus is there an easy way to get a perlbrew perl's @INC to include mod in /usr/lib in edition to those in the perlbrew PATH?
2011-03-16 21:10:38	@antinoos	Added memo for telemachus
2011-03-16 21:13:07	dbbolton	did you check out Modern Perl ?
2011-03-16 21:13:33	nadir	me?
2011-03-16 21:13:38	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-16 21:13:45	nadir	no, is it a book?
2011-03-16 21:13:58	dbbolton	yeah, i posted about it in a thread you started
2011-03-16 21:14:04	dbbolton	regarding perl books
2011-03-16 21:14:13	nadir	i knew i read it somewhere....
2011-03-16 21:14:20	@telemachus	dbbolton: Yeah, you can fiddle with @INC directly
2011-03-16 21:14:20	@antinoos	<dbbolton/#study-group/2011-03-16> is there an easy way to get a perlbrew perl's @INC to include mod in /usr/lib in edition to those in the perlbrew PATH?
2011-03-16 21:14:27	nadir	see it that way: i am not a good programmer.
2011-03-16 21:14:37	nadir	for me it is very weird stuff, everything is very slow.
2011-03-16 21:14:56	nadir	I do the best i can, but don't get forward.
2011-03-16 21:15:11	fsmithred	wait...
2011-03-16 21:15:19	fsmithred	antinoos asks questions now???
2011-03-16 21:15:31	dbbolton	telemachus: ah, that doesn't sound easy
2011-03-16 21:15:42	@telemachus	dbbolton: It can be http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/perl_inc.html
2011-03-16 21:15:49	@telemachus	(Very quick Google hit.)
2011-03-16 21:15:50	dbbolton	fsmithred: i asked the question through !memo
2011-03-16 21:15:56	fsmithred	whew
2011-03-16 21:16:08	dbbolton	telemachus: let me rephrase my question
2011-03-16 21:16:13	@telemachus	I tend to do use lib 'foo';
2011-03-16 21:17:02	dbbolton	i have some scripts in my ~/bin with the 'env perl' interpreter that use modules installed through apt
2011-03-16 21:17:15	dbbolton	and using a perlbrew perl breaks them
2011-03-16 21:17:32	dbbolton	so i want a way to take care of all of them in one swoop
2011-03-16 21:17:36	@telemachus	ah, ok, that's easier - hardcode their shebang line to their specific perls
2011-03-16 21:17:43	@telemachus	sorry, not one swoop
2011-03-16 21:17:48	dbbolton	GAH
2011-03-16 21:17:56	@telemachus	if you code for specific installs, then the shebangs need to match
2011-03-16 21:17:59	@telemachus	sorry
2011-03-16 21:18:06	dbbolton	my temporary solution was 'perlbrew off'
2011-03-16 21:18:30	@telemachus	that works too
2011-03-16 21:18:32	@telemachus	but it's brittle
2011-03-16 21:18:42	@telemachus	I think that's the fancy word for "easy to fuck up"
2011-03-16 21:18:43	fsmithred	sed is your friend
2011-03-16 21:20:05	dbbolton	fsmithred: 'perl -lne' is my friend. sed is a bitter rival.
2011-03-16 21:21:02	dbbolton	also i hate grep
2011-03-16 21:21:20	nadir	how do i grep for "a" or "b" ,btw.
2011-03-16 21:21:30	@telemachus	nadir: with perl :)
2011-03-16 21:21:32	@telemachus	fuck grep
2011-03-16 21:21:34	@telemachus	use ack
2011-03-16 21:21:38	 *	nadir shouts in the background
2011-03-16 21:21:40	@telemachus	cpan App::Ack
2011-03-16 21:21:47	@telemachus	brb
2011-03-16 21:22:09	dbbolton	nadir look at this function: https://github.com/dbbolton/configs/blob/master/zfunctions
2011-03-16 21:22:22	dbbolton	'prep'
2011-03-16 21:24:47	nadir	mhh... trying to understand.
2011-03-16 21:25:05	nadir	an answer like: ls | grep "a" -o "b" would make me more happy.
2011-03-16 21:25:15	nadir	what is "perl -lne" the lne?
2011-03-16 21:26:03	dbbolton	l = automatic line processing
2011-03-16 21:26:42	dbbolton	n = puts a skeleton program like while(<>){ }
2011-03-16 21:27:01	dbbolton	e = code to be executed, goes in the while block
2011-03-16 21:27:53	dbbolton	the '-p' option is similar to '-n' except it includes a 'print' statement at the end ofthe block
2011-03-16 21:28:54	dbbolton	"perl -pe ''" is essentially the same as 'cat'
2011-03-16 21:29:41	@telemachus	nadir: http://blog.ksplice.com/2010/05/top-10-perl-one-liner-tricks/
2011-03-16 21:29:42	nadir	perl -pe my_file.txt
2011-03-16 21:29:45	nadir	from cli?
2011-03-16 21:30:17	dbbolton	no
2011-03-16 21:30:23	dbbolton	you need '' after -e
2011-03-16 21:30:42	nadir	i see.
2011-03-16 21:30:51	nadir	much better than "cat". :-)
2011-03-16 21:31:28	dbbolton	cat is useless anyway
2011-03-16 21:31:44	nadir	So: how do i grep for "a" or "b" with perl from cli?
2011-03-16 21:31:58	dbbolton	nadir: did you read the prep function?
2011-03-16 21:32:05	nadir	i do "ls" and want all files which end with "txt" and all with end with "sh".
2011-03-16 21:32:12	nadir	i read it but it is a bit above me.
2011-03-16 21:32:15	dbbolton	oh
2011-03-16 21:32:17	dbbolton	do
2011-03-16 21:32:49	dbbolton	ls | perl -lne 'print if /\.txt$/;' 
2011-03-16 21:33:00	dbbolton	or, with my function
2011-03-16 21:33:07	dbbolton	ls | prep 'txt$'
2011-03-16 21:33:17	nadir	and where is the "sh" ?
2011-03-16 21:33:25	dbbolton	oops
2011-03-16 21:33:42	dbbolton	then your regex would be /\.(sh|txt)$/
2011-03-16 21:33:51	nadir	cool beans.
2011-03-16 21:34:03	nadir	and what means the "if" ?
2011-03-16 21:34:12	nadir	mh....
2011-03-16 21:34:16	nadir	like in:
2011-03-16 21:34:30	dbbolton	it's a shortcut
2011-03-16 21:34:31	nadir	if (yada-word) { say "foo" }
2011-03-16 21:34:36	nadir	is it the same "if" ?
2011-03-16 21:34:38	dbbolton	no
2011-03-16 21:35:01	dbbolton	if (/PATTERN/) {print;}
2011-03-16 21:35:06	dbbolton	it's short for
2011-03-16 21:35:19	dbbolton	if ( $_ =~ /PATTERN/ )
2011-03-16 21:35:37	dbbolton	and /PATTERN/ is actually short for m/PATTERN/
2011-03-16 21:35:43	dbbolton	m means 'match'
2011-03-16 21:35:50	fsmithred	semi-colon inside the braces?
2011-03-16 21:35:54	nadir	wait.
2011-03-16 21:36:02	nadir	the first / and the last /
2011-03-16 21:36:04	dbbolton	fsmithred: yes
2011-03-16 21:36:15	nadir	of /\.txt$/
2011-03-16 21:36:23	nadir	is just the match-operators?
2011-03-16 21:36:26	@telemachus	if there's only one command that semi is optional, but yeah, it's like { (newline) print; (newline) }
2011-03-16 21:36:51	dbbolton	nadir: you can use anything to delimit the match
2011-03-16 21:37:13	nadir	yes, but those two, in that one-liner you gave, are just the delimiters for a patter?
2011-03-16 21:37:14	dbbolton	m#foo# ; m{foo} ; m~foo~, etc
2011-03-16 21:37:19	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-16 21:37:23	nadir	ok.
2011-03-16 21:37:25	nadir	what is the $
2011-03-16 21:37:27	nadir	?
2011-03-16 21:37:49	nadir	ah, at the end?
2011-03-16 21:37:52	dbbolton	end of string anchor
2011-03-16 21:37:55	nadir	.sh$
2011-03-16 21:38:09	nadir	match a dot, then sh, but only at the end?
2011-03-16 21:38:13	dbbolton	https://github.com/dbbolton/perl-stuff/blob/master/basic-re-cheat.pl
2011-03-16 21:38:20	dbbolton	no, \. matches dot
2011-03-16 21:38:27	dbbolton	. matches anything but newline
2011-03-16 21:39:00	nadir	i hear you.
2011-03-16 21:39:30	nadir	let me try that
2011-03-16 21:40:31	nadir	leck arsch, bin ich gut:
2011-03-16 21:40:34	nadir	$ ls | perl -lne 'print if /^D/'
2011-03-16 21:40:35	nadir	Desktop

2011-03-16 21:40:35	nadir	Downloads
2011-03-16 21:40:35	nadir	$
2011-03-16 21:40:56	nadir	let me make some notes
2011-03-16 21:41:30	dbbolton	i'll pass on the asslicking
2011-03-16 21:41:41	nadir	but its for free.
2011-03-16 21:41:50	nadir	all inclusive.
2011-03-16 21:42:05	dbbolton	well in that case
2011-03-16 21:42:44	nadir	that was a nice little lesson. Not sure if i will remember it, but still. Thanks.
2011-03-16 21:43:09	dbbolton	np
2011-03-16 21:43:50	@telemachus	nadir: One liners are great to know
2011-03-16 21:43:59	@telemachus	I can give you a few other links, if you want.
2011-03-16 21:44:01	fsmithred	I like the cheat sheet
2011-03-16 21:44:12	nadir	telemachus, later, that one is enough for now.
2011-03-16 21:44:18	@telemachus	ok
2011-03-16 21:44:57	dbbolton	the people on commandlinefu.com do not appreciate them.
2011-03-16 21:45:20	fsmithred	they have perfect memory?
2011-03-16 21:45:26	@telemachus	commandlinefu.com prefers awk/sed/etc?
2011-03-16 21:45:44	dbbolton	telemachus: yeah
2011-03-16 21:46:08	dbbolton	moar p|p3s = moar 1337
2011-03-16 21:46:30	dbbolton	shell functions are ok, but perl one liners are gay
2011-03-16 21:47:54	dbbolton	their words
2011-03-16 21:48:34	nadir	"life sucks, but debian rocks" my words.
2011-03-16 21:49:32	dbbolton	prodt
2011-03-16 21:49:35	dbbolton	prost*
2011-03-16 21:50:48	@telemachus	dbbolton: Just remind them that Perl one-liners are portable by definition. Script functions are not, also by definition. Fuck 'em.
2011-03-16 21:50:48	fsmithred	I wanna do it with zeroes and ones
2011-03-16 21:51:02	@telemachus	machine code one liner!
2011-03-16 21:51:13	@telemachus	000011000110001011011101010100
2011-03-16 21:51:33	fsmithred	is that binary for 1337?
2011-03-16 21:51:48	@telemachus	That's binary for "I typed some random ones and zeroes."
2011-03-16 21:52:12	@telemachus	All right, folks, I'm done for the night.
2011-03-16 21:52:22	fsmithred	see you later, telemachus
2011-03-16 21:52:24	@telemachus	See everyone around.
2011-03-16 21:52:27	@telemachus	later

2011-03-16 21:54:33	fsmithred	nope
2011-03-16 21:54:56	nadir	i bookmarked it to show it to you, but forgot about it...
2011-03-16 21:55:12	dbbolton	i've seen it
2011-03-16 21:57:33	dbbolton	similar to gnome-look et alii
2011-03-16 21:57:51	nadir	yes. i guess that is why it catched my eye.
2011-03-16 22:03:27		[dbbolton away: mgs]
2011-03-16 22:08:42	nadir	got to go too. thanks again, that have been some steps.

2011-03-18 18:42:35	@telemachus	dbbolton: That's for your pull request
2011-03-18 18:42:39	@telemachus	evening
2011-03-18 18:42:40	fsmithred	it was a small local thing at the lions club
2011-03-18 18:42:45	dbbolton	telemachus: thanks
2011-03-18 18:42:50	@telemachus	fsmithred: Still very cool. I'm impressed.
2011-03-18 18:43:01	fsmithred	the guy who organized the show was another martial artist
2011-03-18 18:43:14	fsmithred	he was very good at choreographing fights
2011-03-18 18:43:49	fsmithred	most people who do stage combat swing the sword far enough away so that if you don't block, it'll miss you
2011-03-18 18:44:00	fsmithred	he didn't think that looked good enough
2011-03-18 18:44:07	fsmithred	so we didn't do it that way
2011-03-18 18:44:14	@telemachus	When asked how he would work with Yen to direct the action scenes, Hung replied matter-of-factly, "With my mouth."
2011-03-18 18:44:24	@telemachus	Sorry, had to quote it.
2011-03-18 18:44:27	fsmithred	but it was all
2011-03-18 18:44:29	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-18 18:44:57	fsmithred	(still laughing)
2011-03-18 18:45:06	@telemachus	yeah - but looks beat an accidental missing toe (or arm)...
2011-03-18 18:45:07	fsmithred	anyway
2011-03-18 18:45:21	fsmithred	all choreographed and practiced a lot
2011-03-18 18:45:23	fsmithred	slowly
2011-03-18 18:45:35	@telemachus	Right - still - very high stakes.
2011-03-18 18:45:43	fsmithred	gets to where you know if the block is gonna be there or not
2011-03-18 18:45:50	fsmithred	so, pretty safe
2011-03-18 18:46:14	fsmithred	but one year, some rich woman decided to hire some professionals to join in the show
2011-03-18 18:46:22	@telemachus	I'll take your word for that. You sound like stuntmen often do. And it may be completely true.
2011-03-18 18:46:25	fsmithred	they showed up that weekend
2011-03-18 18:46:40	@telemachus	(Professional sword fighters?)
2011-03-18 18:46:44	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-18 18:46:48	fsmithred	Seattle Knights
2011-03-18 18:47:01	fsmithred	they thought we were fucking crazy
2011-03-18 18:47:20	fsmithred	we never had any serious injuries
2011-03-18 18:47:29	fsmithred	lots of fun
2011-03-18 18:48:13	@telemachus	Seattle Knights - good name
2011-03-18 18:48:43	dbbolton	apparently the .xxx TLD was approved today
2011-03-18 18:48:54	fsmithred	oh goody
2011-03-18 18:49:07	fsmithred	who decides what goes there?
2011-03-18 18:49:39	dbbolton	i guess ICANN
2011-03-18 18:49:51	@telemachus	fsmithred: They'll know it when they see it.
2011-03-18 18:49:53	@telemachus	:)
2011-03-18 18:50:00	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-18 18:50:11	@telemachus	Speaking of which - lots of nonsense at the new DF about tits.
2011-03-18 18:50:19	fsmithred	are sites going to be forced to be converted to .xxx?
2011-03-18 18:50:35	fsmithred	oh god, is that shit still going on?
2011-03-18 18:50:40	dbbolton	telemachus: unfortunately i haven't seen any of it
2011-03-18 18:50:45	@telemachus	fsmithred: I haven't heard that the force.
2011-03-18 18:50:50	@telemachus	dbbolton: The tits?
2011-03-18 18:50:57	@telemachus	might I suggest google?
2011-03-18 18:51:10	fsmithred	I posted links to penisis
2011-03-18 18:51:16	fsmithred	penes
2011-03-18 18:51:19	fsmithred	sorry
2011-03-18 18:51:42	dbbolton	i mean within the context of the board
2011-03-18 18:51:42	fsmithred	but it was penis day, after all
2011-03-18 18:51:54	@telemachus	dbbolton: Ah, right, fair enough.
2011-03-18 18:51:58	fsmithred	how'd you miss VHC?
2011-03-18 18:52:05	@telemachus	There was a thread with lots of so called violent hot chicks
2011-03-18 18:52:08	@telemachus	They were not hot.
2011-03-18 18:52:17	fsmithred	I agree
2011-03-18 18:52:19	@telemachus	And the violence was mostly just them holding guns.
2011-03-18 18:52:29	@telemachus	Still, some folks appeared to be very big fans.
2011-03-18 18:52:49	@telemachus	And I think some/much of it was "We're free! See how free we are!"
2011-03-18 18:53:12	@telemachus	But then the shit hit the fan when someone wrote to www-debian, asking to have the new forum listed on debian.org
2011-03-18 18:53:40	@telemachus	and the mailing list mentioned the "tone" of the new forum, specifically mentioning the VHCs
2011-03-18 18:53:53	@telemachus	among other things
2011-03-18 18:54:03	@telemachus	fsmithred: I don't know if it's still going on, to be honest
2011-03-18 18:54:09	@telemachus	I only visit about once a week
2011-03-18 18:54:17	@telemachus	so my sense of "when" things happen is vague
2011-03-18 18:54:41	@telemachus	Anyhow, most of the violent hot chicks have now been replaced with Sesame Street pics
2011-03-18 18:54:43	fsmithred	I believe there's an informal agreement to keep it in the nonsense section
2011-03-18 18:54:53	@telemachus	fsmithred: Ah, k
2011-03-18 18:55:27	fsmithred	but lots of heated discussion around it
2011-03-18 18:55:50	fsmithred	I guess not too heated for an internet discussion
2011-03-18 18:57:23	@telemachus	Right, nobody has said "Nazi" yet, I think.
2011-03-18 18:57:32	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-18 18:57:33	@telemachus	So Godwin's law has not kicked in.
2011-03-18 18:58:11	fsmithred	no, I think the worst it's gone to is comparing it to the old forum
2011-03-18 18:58:19	dbbolton	zing
2011-03-18 18:58:48	@telemachus	Yup - though from Trav, that's pretty much the lowest of the low, I think. Maybe worse than "Nazi".
2011-03-18 18:59:09	dbbolton	i never got what the big fuss was over anyhow
2011-03-18 18:59:16	@telemachus	dbbolton: Which one?
2011-03-18 18:59:55	dbbolton	the zionists migrating to a new forum
2011-03-18 19:00:06	@telemachus	Ah
2011-03-18 19:00:09	@telemachus	Gotcha
2011-03-18 19:00:39	dbbolton	it seemed to be about a single questinoable moderator action
2011-03-18 19:00:40	fsmithred	some old-timers got banned for smacking down a troll, and the troll was allowed to continue
2011-03-18 19:00:48	@telemachus	In a nutshell (my view), the mods on the old forum - very much including me - handled nomko badly.
2011-03-18 19:00:54	@telemachus	We should have banned him right away.
2011-03-18 19:01:04	@telemachus	Well, when we realized.
2011-03-18 19:01:13	fsmithred	...or read him the riot act
2011-03-18 19:01:30	dbbolton	have either of you ever seen 'the website is down'?
2011-03-18 19:01:33	@telemachus	Instead, wedidn't and things just slowly built up
2011-03-18 19:01:47	fsmithred	is that a movie?
2011-03-18 19:01:52	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-18 19:02:00	@telemachus	No, I don't think I ever get that.
2011-03-18 19:02:14	fsmithred	which website?
2011-03-18 19:02:29	dbbolton	thewebsiteisdown.com
2011-03-18 19:02:50	fsmithred	checking
2011-03-18 19:02:54	dbbolton	anyway, i posted a screen cap from it on the Newbuntu forums and got suspended for 3 months
2011-03-18 19:02:57	dbbolton	http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m128/envyouraudience/win98deskfuku.png?t=1300489330
2011-03-18 19:03:16	dbbolton	'explicit sexual image and vulgar language'
2011-03-18 19:03:26	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-18 19:03:26	@telemachus	Looking now - it looks vaguely familiar, but I don't know it.
2011-03-18 19:03:50	dbbolton	i think that's the EXACT OPPOSITE of explicit. what's it called... oh yeah, implicit.
2011-03-18 19:04:36	@telemachus	Pretty funny actually
2011-03-18 19:04:39	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-18 19:04:59	@telemachus	But Ubuntu Forums tend to be strict, no?
2011-03-18 19:05:00	fsmithred	If I were a mod, I'd remove the link, but I'd be laughing about it the whole time
2011-03-18 19:05:20	dbbolton	'strict' is kind of an understatement
2011-03-18 19:05:22	@telemachus	They don't allow you to mention "alternative" methods - like "su".
2011-03-18 19:05:35	dbbolton	'su' falls under vulgar language i believe
2011-03-18 19:05:43	@telemachus	Heh
2011-03-18 19:05:50	dbbolton	or blasphemy 
2011-03-18 19:05:57	@telemachus	Right
2011-03-18 19:06:04	fsmithred	yeah, 'sudo passwd' is taboo
2011-03-18 19:06:12	fsmithred	mentioning it, I mean
2011-03-18 19:07:09	dbbolton	i only started using debian because etch (i believe it was testing at the time) was the only distro on which i could get X to work
2011-03-18 19:07:26	dbbolton	but thank linus i did
2011-03-18 19:07:42	@telemachus	Having said that, I'm often disappointed at the silly way people on _our_ forums react to "sudo"
2011-03-18 19:07:49	@telemachus	The whole thing gets goofy fast.
2011-03-18 19:07:59	@telemachus	su/sudo, apt-get/aptitude/synaptic
2011-03-18 19:08:01	@telemachus	blurgh
2011-03-18 19:08:12	dbbolton	vim/emacs kde/gnome
2011-03-18 19:08:26	@telemachus	vim/emacs is not a subject of debate
2011-03-18 19:08:28	@telemachus	as you know
2011-03-18 19:08:34	@telemachus	and both kde/gnome suck
2011-03-18 19:08:37	@telemachus	also not an issue
2011-03-18 19:08:38	@telemachus	:)
2011-03-18 19:08:41	@telemachus	see, I'm not above it
2011-03-18 19:08:47	 *	telemachus sighs
2011-03-18 19:09:11	@telemachus	Though the _really_ funny thing is that I haven't run X in a Debian machine in over two years.
2011-03-18 19:09:12	dbbolton	i wish i disagreed with you so we could argue about it
2011-03-18 19:09:38	dbbolton	do you do all your GUI work on OSX
2011-03-18 19:09:39	@telemachus	I was a mod at DF, all the while being a Debian for servers, OSX for desktops user.
2011-03-18 19:09:42	@telemachus	Yes
2011-03-18 19:09:55	@telemachus	Not honestly by choice, but such is life.
2011-03-18 19:10:01	@telemachus	My employer buys my machines.
2011-03-18 19:10:04	fsmithred	yikes! I need to vacuum out the computer before I do this install
2011-03-18 19:10:18	@telemachus	And I'm too cheap to buy another, just to say I run a libre desktop.
2011-03-18 19:10:24	fsmithred	and I need another sata cable
2011-03-18 19:10:43	dbbolton	at least it's vaguely UNIX-like
2011-03-18 19:10:48	@telemachus	dbbolton: Agreed.
2011-03-18 19:10:50	fsmithred	if I concentrate hard enough, do you think one will appear in an old motherboard box?
2011-03-18 19:10:54	@telemachus	I would not work in a windows shop.
2011-03-18 19:10:59	@telemachus	fsmithred: No
2011-03-18 19:11:27	dbbolton	fsmithred: i would just pilfer parts from a different computer
2011-03-18 19:11:29	@telemachus	I detest Apple's policies, but at least their hardware is often well-made, and the underlying OS is very nice.
2011-03-18 19:11:41	@telemachus	Makes me think better of BSD in fact.
2011-03-18 19:11:46	fsmithred	well, I wanted to run two computers at once
2011-03-18 19:11:58	fsmithred	I got my stuff on three different hard drives
2011-03-18 19:11:58	dbbolton	did you hear about their recent devkit change
2011-03-18 19:12:09	@telemachus	dbbolton: Xcode 4?
2011-03-18 19:12:10	@telemachus	yes
2011-03-18 19:12:15	fsmithred	guess I could use IDE for the second box
2011-03-18 19:12:34	fsmithred	if I could remember what's on which hard drive
2011-03-18 19:12:55	dbbolton	on ars?
2011-03-18 19:13:18	@telemachus	dbbolton: Sorry?
2011-03-18 19:13:22	@telemachus	Ars Technica?
2011-03-18 19:13:29	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-18 19:13:44	@telemachus	Ah, then I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean. Was this today?
2011-03-18 19:14:10	dbbolton	i mean did you heard about it through ars
2011-03-18 19:14:13	dbbolton	last week, i think
2011-03-18 19:14:36	@telemachus	Hmm, I think I heard about it through Homebrew
2011-03-18 19:15:22	@telemachus	Now I'm wondering if we're talking about the same thing
2011-03-18 19:15:31	dbbolton	i also read there that ZFS will be incorporated into OSX soon
2011-03-18 19:16:17	@telemachus	https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Bootstrapping-CC
2011-03-18 19:16:39	@telemachus	I saw something today about ZFS on Hackernews
2011-03-18 19:16:47	@telemachus	but they've been saying that for some time.
2011-03-18 19:16:53	@telemachus	I'm not convinced yet.
2011-03-18 19:17:23	dbbolton	i was going to try it with FreeBSD once but it ruined my partition table so i gave up on it
2011-03-18 19:17:55	@telemachus	clang/llvm you mean?
2011-03-18 19:18:13	dbbolton	i dont think so
2011-03-18 19:18:21	@telemachus	oh, zfs
2011-03-18 19:18:22	@telemachus	sorry
2011-03-18 19:18:24	@telemachus	lost the thread
2011-03-18 19:18:28	@telemachus	I'm back
2011-03-18 19:21:28	@telemachus	dbbolton: When you write code do you write tests - always, sometimes, never?
2011-03-18 19:21:54	@telemachus	I'm a sometimes guy, and no judging.
2011-03-18 19:21:56	@telemachus	Just curious.
2011-03-18 19:23:42	dbbolton	if it's a relatively complex program, yeah
2011-03-18 19:24:06	dbbolton	i don't use Test::More or something to that effect though
2011-03-18 19:24:21	@telemachus	That was my next question.
2011-03-18 19:24:26	@telemachus	Just print statements?
2011-03-18 19:25:11	dbbolton	i make a log file with an option
2011-03-18 19:25:59	dbbolton	then 'say $log "entering &subx with @_" if $logging;' or something like that
2011-03-18 19:26:06	@telemachus	to watch what the program does ok, right
2011-03-18 19:26:16	dbbolton	yeah
2011-03-18 19:27:31	@telemachus	Have you tried Test::More and not liked it or just never thought that sort of testing was worth it?
2011-03-18 19:27:46	@telemachus	Again, I'm not judging, just thinking about it all myself.
2011-03-18 19:28:33	@telemachus	I keep saying that because some "test all the fucking time" people are very unpleasant.
2011-03-18 19:29:19	dbbolton	havent tried it
2011-03-18 19:29:35	dbbolton	briefly looked at the doc and decided it was overkill
2011-03-18 19:30:02	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-18 19:32:50	dbbolton	what about you
2011-03-18 19:34:22	@telemachus	I never wrote tests when I learned Perl
2011-03-18 19:34:29	@telemachus	Then I got into it a bit with Ruby
2011-03-18 19:34:43	@telemachus	and on more complex things I now find testing pretty helpful
2011-03-18 19:34:52	@telemachus	So now as I come back to Perl I'm taking a look
2011-03-18 19:35:02	@telemachus	and I've been using Test::More some
2011-03-18 19:35:10	@telemachus	overall I like it
2011-03-18 19:35:49	@telemachus	I'm actually considering writing a Ruby port of it
2011-03-18 19:35:57	@telemachus	Ruby's testing tools are much more complicated
2011-03-18 19:36:14	@telemachus	And only one of them uses the TAP protocol and even at that not by default.
2011-03-18 19:36:40	@telemachus	Having said all that, I still find it _very_ hard to do true TDD - to write the tests first.
2011-03-18 19:36:55	@telemachus	Part of me thinks I should learn that - so many people swear by it.
2011-03-18 19:36:59	@telemachus	But I find it unnatural.
2011-03-18 19:38:12	dbbolton	i think i would only do that if i were in the programming profession
2011-03-18 19:38:37	fsmithred	I have to turn the computer off for a bit
2011-03-18 19:38:41	fsmithred	see you folks later

2011-03-18 19:39:34	@telemachus	dbbolton: I get that.
2011-03-18 19:39:43	@telemachus	And I'm nowhere near a professional programmer.
2011-03-18 19:39:50	@telemachus	But part of me is a want-to-be, I guess.
2011-03-18 19:40:26	@telemachus	I always feel guilty/inadequate for not being more serious about it all. I mostly work like a standard sys-admin: Do what works, then stop.
2011-03-18 19:41:01	@telemachus	Anyhow, just curious.
2011-03-18 19:41:13	@telemachus	Also wondering if I should introduce Test::Simple to the class
2011-03-18 19:41:31	@telemachus	Test::Simple is basically Test::More, but less
2011-03-18 19:41:32	@telemachus	:)
2011-03-18 19:41:54	@telemachus	pretty much just the ok($try, $expected, "Name of test") method
2011-03-18 19:44:13	dbbolton	how far along is the class?
2011-03-18 19:46:30	@telemachus	Heh - that's a tricky question.
2011-03-18 19:46:38	@telemachus	We made it to chapter 8 or 9 of Learning Perl
2011-03-18 19:46:46	@telemachus	the second chapter on regular expressions
2011-03-18 19:46:46	@telemachus	but
2011-03-18 19:46:58	@telemachus	they had become pretty frustrated with the book
2011-03-18 19:47:13	@telemachus	so we're backtracking and reviewing things now, using a different book
2011-03-18 19:47:27	@telemachus	The Perl Training Australia Programming Perl
2011-03-18 19:47:41	@telemachus	we're redoing some basics, in order to move forward again
2011-03-18 19:48:21	@telemachus	Ah, apologies
2011-03-18 19:48:28	@telemachus	I need to pop off and make some dinner

2011-03-19 12:23:36	nadir	good
2011-03-19 12:23:41	@telemachus	It's tomorrow, right?
2011-03-19 12:23:41	nadir	hello too.
2011-03-19 12:23:47	nadir	don't ask me.
2011-03-19 12:23:58	nadir	But it seems so.
2011-03-19 12:24:18	nadir	you realize that you are nominated as admin?
2011-03-19 12:24:30	@telemachus	Pardon?

2011-03-19 12:24:44	nadir	second.
2011-03-19 12:24:46	@telemachus	k

2011-03-19 12:24:50	@telemachus	ok
2011-03-19 12:24:51	@telemachus	pick one
2011-03-19 12:24:52	@telemachus	:)
2011-03-19 12:24:55	nadir	first: don't ask me:
2011-03-19 12:25:02	nadir	don't ask me when is what.

2011-03-19 12:25:22	nadir	I assume the perl learning group is tomorrow. Germany 05:00 afternoon.
2011-03-19 12:25:25	nadir	but i would not bet.
2011-03-19 12:25:31	nadir	hence: don't ask me.
2011-03-19 12:25:36	nadir	ok?
2011-03-19 12:26:00	nadir	i take it as a yes.

2011-03-19 12:26:40	@telemachus	Sunday March 20th, UTC 16:00ish start time
2011-03-19 12:26:43	nadir	but time is kind of a problem for me (in general, not in international terms)
2011-03-19 12:27:02	@telemachus	With a link to converter
2011-03-19 12:27:07	nadir	I will pop in as soon as possible.
2011-03-19 12:27:07	@telemachus	ok, that subject is good
2011-03-19 12:27:42	@telemachus	Now, I'm nominated for admin?
2011-03-19 12:27:47	nadir	yes.
2011-03-19 12:27:57	nadir	but not by me, before you go mad at me.
2011-03-19 12:28:12	@telemachus	Bremin is same time as Berlin, right?
2011-03-19 12:28:16	@telemachus	Bremen, sorry
2011-03-19 12:28:17	nadir	yes.
2011-03-19 12:28:28	@telemachus	k, then it's 5:00pm
2011-03-19 12:28:37	nadir	In Europe most times are similar (not more than 1 hour from each other). afaik.
2011-03-19 12:28:53	@telemachus	Right, I thought so - you've told me that before.
2011-03-19 12:29:03	nadir	thanks, i am quite sure about the 5 pm. but i would not bet, like said.
2011-03-19 12:30:33	@telemachus	gotcha
2011-03-19 12:30:58	nadir	once a prof asked me how old i was. I did not know.
2011-03-19 12:31:01	nadir	for real.
2011-03-19 12:31:10	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-19 12:32:51	@telemachus	So how is Perl going?
2011-03-19 12:33:05	nadir	better.
2011-03-19 12:33:14	nadir	if i find some code i can show you.
2011-03-19 12:33:21	nadir	sexy, but a lot of "print".
2011-03-19 12:33:33	@telemachus	Cool. I'm writing up examples to post in a Github repo.
2011-03-19 12:33:36	@telemachus	A bit late, but still...
2011-03-19 12:34:15	nadir	mhh....
2011-03-19 12:34:28	nadir	i would need to boot the laptop. Should take a bit less than 5 minutes.
2011-03-19 12:34:41	@telemachus	No problem. I'm here working anyhow.
2011-03-19 12:34:54	nadir	ok. give me a bit.
2011-03-19 12:34:58	@telemachus	k
2011-03-19 12:40:48	nadir	here it is; a classical nadir:
2011-03-19 12:40:52	nadir	https://gist.github.com/877592
2011-03-19 12:41:27	@telemachus	opening
2011-03-19 12:42:19	@telemachus	delete $all_users{troll} ;
2011-03-19 12:42:21	@telemachus	cute
2011-03-19 12:43:06	nadir	yes, i think too. Something like that is what i am training.
2011-03-19 12:43:14	nadir	adding values, deleting values.
2011-03-19 12:43:23	@telemachus	Nice
2011-03-19 12:43:30	@telemachus	It looks good overall I think
2011-03-19 12:43:39	@telemachus	Two thoughts, both small
2011-03-19 12:43:57	@telemachus	1) Play with 'say' instead of 'print' always. It saves you typing "\n" at the end.
2011-03-19 12:44:05	nadir	k
2011-03-19 12:44:32	@telemachus	2) You have a funny habit of putting a space after an initial parenthesis but not before the final, like this: my @array = ( "foo", "bar");
2011-03-19 12:45:01	@telemachus	It's not a huge deal, but it jumps out at me. In general, you want to pick either no spaces or both, you know?
2011-03-19 12:45:04	nadir	should i delete the first space, or should i add one at the end?
2011-03-19 12:45:16	nadir	ah, i hear you.
2011-03-19 12:45:25	@telemachus	Most Perl people do the following: for simple things, delete the first, for complex things, add the second.
2011-03-19 12:45:26	nadir	at least do it the same at both ends.
2011-03-19 12:45:34	@telemachus	So far, all your stuff is simple.
2011-03-19 12:45:42	@telemachus	You'll learn what complex looks like as we go.
2011-03-19 12:45:43	nadir	grml....
2011-03-19 12:45:47	nadir	:-)
2011-03-19 12:45:53	nadir	one short question
2011-03-19 12:46:00	nadir	If i ask for <STDIN>
2011-03-19 12:46:04	nadir	and want to chomp it.
2011-03-19 12:46:08	nadir	Do i first ask,
2011-03-19 12:46:20	nadir	and in the next line do "chomp $whatever"
2011-03-19 12:46:33	nadir	or do i do it during the "declaration" ?
2011-03-19 12:46:42	@telemachus	better to do it in one step
2011-03-19 12:46:53	@telemachus	chomp(my $foo = <STDIN>);
2011-03-19 12:47:10	nadir	and the parantheses (sp) are necessary?
2011-03-19 12:47:20	nadir	that might have been my fault then.
2011-03-19 12:48:23	@telemachus	yes, I believe those parentheses are required
2011-03-19 12:48:41	nadir	ok.
2011-03-19 12:49:08	@telemachus	But I need to think for a moment to explain why.
2011-03-19 12:49:17	@telemachus	Let's see...
2011-03-19 12:51:26	@telemachus	Ok, the error you get is this: Can't modify scalar chomp in scalar assignment at parens line 5, near "<STDIN>;"
2011-03-19 12:52:02	@telemachus	That suggests that the problem is that perl ends up trying to assign <STDIN> to 'chomp', as if it were a variable
2011-03-19 12:52:29	nadir	mhh... i can't say i fully understand.
2011-03-19 12:53:09	nadir	not that your explanation was not good.
2011-03-19 12:54:02	@telemachus	The Perl interpreter can't parse chomp my $foo without the parens as two things.
2011-03-19 12:54:16	@telemachus	So it grabs the thing on the far left and says, "Ok, you must be my variable."
2011-03-19 12:54:27	@telemachus	Then it tries to put the value of <STDIN> into it.
2011-03-19 12:54:34	@telemachus	That blows up, since 'chomp' is a keyword.
2011-03-19 12:54:44	@telemachus	I think.
2011-03-19 12:54:49	@telemachus	More testing, one sec...
2011-03-19 12:55:15	@telemachus	Yeah
2011-03-19 12:55:20	@telemachus	If you change the line to this: chomp = <STDIN>;
2011-03-19 12:55:24	@telemachus	You get the identical error.
2011-03-19 12:55:29	@telemachus	So that must be what happens.
2011-03-19 12:55:42	nadir	mhh... i am getting closer.
2011-03-19 12:56:00	nadir	in your last example it would try to "chomp the =" ; i guess.
2011-03-19 12:56:11	@telemachus	So look at it again with and without parens.
2011-03-19 12:56:22	nadir	sec
2011-03-19 12:56:40	@telemachus	No, it doesn't try to chomp the '=' sign. The equal sign is very high priority, higher than 'chomp'
2011-03-19 12:56:48	@telemachus	So the first thing Perl tries to do is the assignment.
2011-03-19 12:57:05	nadir	aha. good.
2011-03-19 12:57:13	@telemachus	That means it (1) gets a value from STDIN - that part goes ok and then (2) tries to put the value into 'chomp'.
2011-03-19 12:57:27	@telemachus	And _that_ is when things go boom.
2011-03-19 12:59:26	nadir	mhh. why?
2011-03-19 12:59:41	nadir	if STDIN has got a newline, why can't it chomp it?
2011-03-19 13:00:13	@telemachus	No, no. It tries to assign the value to 'chomp', as if 'chomp' was a variable.
2011-03-19 13:00:27	@telemachus	But 'chomp' isn't a variable. It's a keyword and a function.
2011-03-19 13:00:50	@telemachus	So _that_ blows up. The attempted assignment blows up, the chomp never gets tried.
2011-03-19 13:01:15	nadir	i tried it like this ( i seem to recall):
2011-03-19 13:01:24	nadir	my $name = chomp <STDIN> ;
2011-03-19 13:01:40	nadir	not that it would be that important. It does not work, and ok.
2011-03-19 13:01:51	@telemachus	Ah, no, that's good.
2011-03-19 13:01:56	nadir	yes?
2011-03-19 13:01:57	@telemachus	It won't work, but good to talk about.
2011-03-19 13:02:01	nadir	ah.
2011-03-19 13:02:02	nadir	lol
2011-03-19 13:02:23	@telemachus	here's why it won't work: you are trying to chomp the result of <STDIN> directly, but in Perl, you can't do that.
2011-03-19 13:02:32	@telemachus	the direct result of <STDIN> is some string.
2011-03-19 13:02:45	@telemachus	You can't chomp a string directly - you can only chomp one that is held in a variable.
2011-03-19 13:02:54	@telemachus	A string directly is immutable, so to speak.
2011-03-19 13:03:06	nadir	always? chomp variables. full stop?
2011-03-19 13:03:24	nadir	ah, ok: string is immutable. ok, i heard that before.
2011-03-19 13:03:58	nadir	here is the error message, in case it helps :
2011-03-19 13:04:02	nadir	Can't modify <HANDLE> in chomp at a_test.pl line 12, near "<STDIN> ;"
2011-03-19 13:04:11	nadir	(helps me... not you)
2011-03-19 13:05:01	@telemachus	right
2011-03-19 13:05:25	@telemachus	it's trying to chomp the <STDIN> and "can't modify" is its way of saying, "Ouch. You're hurting me."
2011-03-19 13:05:53	nadir	little jump: is there a shortcut for <STDIN> ?
2011-03-19 13:07:02	@telemachus	No, I don't believe so.
2011-03-19 13:07:35	@telemachus	You find it annoying to type?
2011-03-19 13:07:36	nadir	that is very strange. With all that ranting about every non-typing being helpfull
2011-03-19 13:07:43	nadir	yes, i am bad with upper letters.
2011-03-19 13:07:55	@telemachus	Well, that ranting was Randal and company, not Larry himself.
2011-03-19 13:08:01	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-03-19 13:08:04	@telemachus	He may have felt it was so standard as to leave it.
2011-03-19 13:08:06	@telemachus	Not sure.
2011-03-19 13:08:23	nadir	no problem. no shortcut. i got to live with it.
2011-03-19 13:08:24	@telemachus	I believe you could dupe it, but I'm not sure of the possible effects.
2011-03-19 13:08:28	@telemachus	one sec
2011-03-19 13:11:19	⇨	fsmithred (~fsmithred@pool-72-72-121-113.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has joined #study-group
2011-03-19 13:11:26	fsmithred	hey nadir!
2011-03-19 13:11:46	nadir	yo. the fresh-born-developer :-)
2011-03-19 13:11:54	nadir	glad to see you around.
2011-03-19 13:12:21	fsmithred	hi, sorry I'm late, I was studying
2011-03-19 13:12:28	fsmithred	studying the backs of my eyelids
2011-03-19 13:12:48	nadir	ah. any insight?
2011-03-19 13:12:49	fsmithred	stayed up way too late last night
2011-03-19 13:12:53	fsmithred	nope
2011-03-19 13:12:56	nadir	dang.
2011-03-19 13:13:03	fsmithred	so, I used my installer yesterday
2011-03-19 13:13:06	nadir	i got my best ideas in bed.
2011-03-19 13:13:13	fsmithred	on my real system
2011-03-19 13:13:31	fsmithred	but I chickened out an unplugged the second hard drive
2011-03-19 13:13:51	fsmithred	too much data I didn't want to take a chance with
2011-03-19 13:13:54	@telemachus	hey fsmithred
2011-03-19 13:13:57	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/877627
2011-03-19 13:14:00	fsmithred	hi tele
2011-03-19 13:14:06	@telemachus	nadir: you could do that, but I don't really recommend it.
2011-03-19 13:14:39	nadir	thanks for checking.  I will not do it. I will get used to upper letters and be done with it.
2011-03-19 13:15:22	@telemachus	Yeah, honestly for a few things, that's best.
2011-03-19 13:15:29	@telemachus	STDIN, STDERR, STDOUT
2011-03-19 13:15:33	@telemachus	maybe a few others
2011-03-19 13:15:39	@telemachus	%ENV, @ARGV
2011-03-19 13:15:58	@telemachus	Larry Wall is an old neck-beard Unix guy, so he uses all-caps for certain constants.
2011-03-19 13:15:59	fsmithred	why quotes?
2011-03-19 13:16:04	@telemachus	It's an old habit.
2011-03-19 13:16:08	@telemachus	fsmithred: pardon?
2011-03-19 13:16:09	fsmithred	instead of diamond?
2011-03-19 13:16:13	@telemachus	for 'STDIN'?
2011-03-19 13:16:17	fsmithred	y
2011-03-19 13:16:20	@telemachus	Ah, right, we were doing something weird.
2011-03-19 13:16:39	@telemachus	Nadir wanted to know if we could get it so he could get at STDIN without typing caps.
2011-03-19 13:16:40	fsmithred	oh, I see it now
2011-03-19 13:16:49	@telemachus	So I assign 'STDIN' to a var
2011-03-19 13:17:11	@telemachus	by the way, I should mention to both of you <STDIN> may not be quite what you think
2011-03-19 13:17:32	@telemachus	STDIN is a bareword filehandle name and <> is the "read one line of input" operator
2011-03-19 13:17:44	@telemachus	It's not one thing <STDIN> - it's two.
2011-03-19 13:17:54	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-19 13:17:56	fsmithred	makes sense
2011-03-19 13:18:09	@telemachus	well, actually <> is the "read input" operator
2011-03-19 13:18:22	@telemachus	In a scalar context it reads one line. In a list context it reads all the input
2011-03-19 13:18:25	@telemachus	Sorry
2011-03-19 13:18:30	@telemachus	was imprecise
2011-03-19 13:19:25	fsmithred	are we actually having class right now?
2011-03-19 13:19:39	@telemachus	Nope
2011-03-19 13:19:42	@telemachus	just chatting
2011-03-19 13:19:43	fsmithred	whew
2011-03-19 13:19:46	@telemachus	class is tomorrow, right?
2011-03-19 13:19:51	fsmithred	yeah, I thought so
2011-03-19 13:20:07	fsmithred	I'm barely awake right now
2011-03-19 13:20:11	@telemachus	k
2011-03-19 13:20:33	fsmithred	btw, great movie recommendataion
2011-03-19 13:20:51	fsmithred	one of the best
2011-03-19 13:21:41	@telemachus	you saw it already?
2011-03-19 13:21:44	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-19 13:21:45	@telemachus	I loved it, yeah
2011-03-19 13:21:47	@telemachus	Awesome
2011-03-19 13:21:49	@telemachus	So glad.
2011-03-19 13:21:55	fsmithred	told you, the rental place is 24/7
2011-03-19 13:22:00	@telemachus	Want to hear a truly funny story of how I heard of it?
2011-03-19 13:22:04	fsmithred	at 1.5mbs
2011-03-19 13:22:09	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-19 13:22:11	fsmithred	mb/s
2011-03-19 13:22:16	@telemachus	cool
2011-03-19 13:22:16	fsmithred	sure
2011-03-19 13:22:37	fsmithred	apparently, there's a second and a third movie
2011-03-19 13:22:49	@telemachus	My wife is in line in a Starbucks. Two guys ahead of her are chatting. Turns out they're sysadmins. She picks up because of shit she hears from me.
2011-03-19 13:23:10	@telemachus	They're talking about various things and the issue of warning users when restarting the network comes up.
2011-03-19 13:23:30	@telemachus	One says, "Fuck 'em. I just restart. By the time they call, I say Oh, it's working now..."
2011-03-19 13:24:01	@telemachus	She laughs and is drawn into conversation, ends up hearing about this kung fu movie, tells her husband...
2011-03-19 13:24:05	@telemachus	The rest is history.
2011-03-19 13:24:13	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 13:24:29	@telemachus	She said she couldn't help laughing out loud since it sounded like something I would say.
2011-03-19 13:24:37	@telemachus	Which is why she figured I might like the same movies.
2011-03-19 13:24:52	@telemachus	Second one yes, I think third is not yet made - planned maybe?
2011-03-19 13:25:01	fsmithred	not sure
2011-03-19 13:25:06	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-19 13:26:17	fsmithred	hard to tell
2011-03-19 13:26:27	fsmithred	name is 'the legend is born'
2011-03-19 13:26:29	fsmithred	2010
2011-03-19 13:26:35	fsmithred	some say 2, some say 3
2011-03-19 13:27:05	fsmithred	I heard a story about him today from my teacher
2011-03-19 13:27:28	fsmithred	somehow he managed to be in a movie when he was very old
2011-03-19 13:28:03	fsmithred	director told him that in the scene, some thugs came in, and he had to throw them through the door
2011-03-19 13:28:11	@telemachus	The googles say not out yet - yeah, people seem to talk about a third movie (which was about his youth?) as if it were 3, but apparently others say no.
2011-03-19 13:28:15	fsmithred	stunt men quit after that
2011-03-19 13:28:18	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-19 13:29:01	@telemachus	rofl i know its the 3rd movie made idiot my point was it has nothing do with the donnie yen ip man movies but﻿ some how who ever made the movie can just title it as ip man 3 oviously for attention sales and idiots like u will be oh its ip man 3 its like some random cunt making iron man 3 with different actors and everything wake the fuck up u lala land cunt
2011-03-19 13:29:08	@telemachus	That's a quote, btw
2011-03-19 13:29:10	@telemachus	not me :)

2011-03-19 13:30:18	@telemachus	lala land cunt is good
2011-03-19 13:31:37	nadir	check the post cunt...ergh... count:
2011-03-19 13:31:41	nadir	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/virtualbox-on-lenny-869455/#post4296227
2011-03-19 13:31:57	nadir	might be the right time to replace jalu with nadir.
2011-03-19 13:32:56	fsmithred	actually, that might be the wrong number
2011-03-19 13:33:09	fsmithred	I read somewhere that it's a translation error, and it's really 661
2011-03-19 13:33:16	nadir	damn.
2011-03-19 13:33:32	fsmithred	but everyone knows 666, so you may be right
2011-03-19 13:34:01	fsmithred	ok, so I got a question about guest additions
2011-03-19 13:35:02	fsmithred	what's the difference between clicking on "install guest additions" in the vbox window vs. attaching the file as a cd and going into it inside the vm and running the file?
2011-03-19 13:35:22	@telemachus	I'm so confused
2011-03-19 13:35:32	fsmithred	keep up
2011-03-19 13:35:41	@telemachus	k
2011-03-19 13:35:42	nadir	mhh...
2011-03-19 13:35:51	nadir	you first need to donwload it.
2011-03-19 13:35:59	nadir	by clicking on" install guest additions"
2011-03-19 13:36:06	nadir	that downloads the *.iso
2011-03-19 13:36:13	nadir	after that you have to install it.
2011-03-19 13:36:17	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-19 13:36:17	nadir	ok?
2011-03-19 13:36:20	nadir	good
2011-03-19 13:36:21	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-19 13:36:25	nadir	and yes: it is confusing.
2011-03-19 13:36:44	fsmithred	except the latest one I have screwed up at least one vm so I couldn't boot into it
2011-03-19 13:36:53	nadir	yes?
2011-03-19 13:36:55	fsmithred	so I've been using an older version of the guest additions
2011-03-19 13:37:11	fsmithred	yeah, I read some posts about it, but nothing anyone suggested worked for me
2011-03-19 13:37:25	nadir	how did you screw it?
2011-03-19 13:37:26	fsmithred	lucky for me, they were disposable vms
2011-03-19 13:37:33	fsmithred	just by instlaling,
2011-03-19 13:37:39	fsmithred	then couldn't boot into it anymore
2011-03-19 13:37:39	nadir	that sounds strange.
2011-03-19 13:38:08	nadir	not that vbox would not be a good candidate for strange things.
2011-03-19 13:39:18	fsmithred	wow, my new /home is only 12%full
2011-03-19 13:40:02	fsmithred	still copying stuff back
2011-03-19 13:40:12	fsmithred	I better stop until I get more caffeine
2011-03-19 13:40:23	fsmithred	trying to reorganize here
2011-03-19 13:40:57	fsmithred	stuff is on four different drives
2011-03-19 13:41:25	nadir	holy big bang.
2011-03-19 13:42:04	fsmithred	yeah, I got a little bit backup up here and a little there
2011-03-19 13:42:09	fsmithred	different ages
2011-03-19 13:42:13	fsmithred	all fucked up
2011-03-19 13:42:27	fsmithred	useless partitions
2011-03-19 13:42:34	nadir	i try hard to keep things organized, but i can't say it works
2011-03-19 13:42:44	fsmithred	I'm trying to do that now
2011-03-19 13:43:20	fsmithred	repartitioned so I have 2.4g /boot, 12g /, 280g /home
2011-03-19 13:43:25	fsmithred	and got rid of the lvm
2011-03-19 13:43:33	fsmithred	that's a relief
2011-03-19 13:43:59	nadir	ah, oh, ufff.... speaking of lvm
2011-03-19 13:44:07	nadir	I installed Sabayon again.
2011-03-19 13:44:14	nadir	Seen that installer yours is a diamond.
2011-03-19 13:44:16	fsmithred	wiggly windows?
2011-03-19 13:44:19	nadir	really, no kidding.
2011-03-19 13:44:49	fsmithred	I had an idea to improve it, but I forget what it was
2011-03-19 13:44:55	nadir	 wiggly -> wobbly ?
2011-03-19 13:44:58	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-19 13:45:02	nadir	it is in a perfect move.
2011-03-19 13:45:19	fsmithred	one time I tried sabayon, I couldn't turn that shit off quick enough
2011-03-19 13:45:23	nadir	cause you say "improve". There have been lots of improvements
2011-03-19 13:45:42	fsmithred	I'll have to use it again to remember what I wanted to add
2011-03-19 13:45:42	nadir	I use the xfce, and it does not come with compiz.
2011-03-19 13:45:57	fsmithred	there's some kind of compositing in xfce
2011-03-19 13:46:02	fsmithred	I found it by accident this morning
2011-03-19 13:46:05	nadir	yes. i know.
2011-03-19 13:46:30	nadir	i tried your installer with your version of xfce.
2011-03-19 13:46:39	nadir	I did it in Vbox, and have picked encryption.
2011-03-19 13:46:51	nadir	That was not a good idea, and after a few hours i gave up.
2011-03-19 13:47:00	nadir	But it seems very sane now.
2011-03-19 13:47:00	fsmithred	why?
2011-03-19 13:47:04	nadir	too long
2011-03-19 13:47:06	fsmithred	what went wrong?
2011-03-19 13:47:11	fsmithred	oh, yeah
2011-03-19 13:47:15	nadir	it wrote /dev/nothing forever.
2011-03-19 13:47:20	nadir	ok.
2011-03-19 13:47:26	fsmithred	my drive was already encrypted, so I skipped that part
2011-03-19 13:47:30	nadir	I got to test it without encryption.
2011-03-19 13:47:40	nadir	But it is very clear now.
2011-03-19 13:47:45	nadir	It is a good installer.
2011-03-19 13:47:50	fsmithred	you can still encrypt without writing from /dev/urandom
2011-03-19 13:47:59	nadir	I did not find that option.
2011-03-19 13:48:09	nadir	but you know that i don't read much...
2011-03-19 13:48:10	fsmithred	don't check the write random button
2011-03-19 13:48:16	nadir	damn.
2011-03-19 13:48:36	nadir	I had none of those choices for Sabayon.
2011-03-19 13:48:37	fsmithred	only difference is the bad guys will have less to sift through to decrypt your data
2011-03-19 13:48:49	nadir	it picks lvm without asking, and it installs grub without asking.
2011-03-19 13:49:01	fsmithred	yikes
2011-03-19 13:49:10	nadir	If the bad guys want to read my vim-perl-python-books:
2011-03-19 13:49:11	fsmithred	don't mess with my bootloader without asking!
2011-03-19 13:49:13	nadir	so shall it be.
2011-03-19 13:49:16	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 13:49:41	nadir	The only thing which might reveal something are my Mails.
2011-03-19 13:49:47	nadir	but i don't think very much.
2011-03-19 13:49:55	fsmithred	oh, one idea I had was to make the size of the swap file selectable
2011-03-19 13:50:08	nadir	That sounds like a good idea.
2011-03-19 13:50:22	nadir	but keep in mind that you have to rewrite all of that in perl.
2011-03-19 13:50:25	fsmithred	got a question for anyone who knows the answer
2011-03-19 13:50:31	nadir	so better keep it small :-)
2011-03-19 13:50:53	fsmithred	can you hibernate with a swap file, and does it make a difference if it's on an encrypted partition?
2011-03-19 13:51:21	fsmithred	won't it shrink when it's in perl?
2011-03-19 13:52:16	nadir	probably a one-liner in perl
2011-03-19 13:52:31	nadir	with all special signs out there.
2011-03-19 13:52:59	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 13:54:09	nadir	i did never hibernate, and i don't even know what that is.
2011-03-19 13:54:29	fsmithred	it saves the current running state in swap and shuts off the machine
2011-03-19 13:54:38	nadir	oh?
2011-03-19 13:54:40	fsmithred	then when you turn it on, it goes back to exactly where it was
2011-03-19 13:54:47	fsmithred	...without asking for a password
2011-03-19 13:55:08	fsmithred	swap has to be at least as big as your ram
2011-03-19 13:55:28	nadir	i heard that. but without knowing what hibernation is that was not of much use.
2011-03-19 13:55:40	fsmithred	people with notebooks like it, I think
2011-03-19 13:55:47	fsmithred	saves time, saves battery
2011-03-19 13:56:20	nadir	uhum.
2011-03-19 13:56:34	nadir	as you know my laptop experience is a very fresh one.
2011-03-19 13:56:48	fsmithred	yeah, it'll take you awhile to get used to it
2011-03-19 13:56:50	nadir	but yes, i need a way to make it work longer.
2011-03-19 13:57:10	fsmithred	how long does the battery last?
2011-03-19 13:57:47	nadir	right now i am very active ( i compile kernels, install vbox-OSes, what not)
2011-03-19 13:57:54	nadir	as far i see it lasts about 2 hours.
2011-03-19 13:58:00	nadir	ah, and i reboot a lot.
2011-03-19 13:58:06	fsmithred	sounds pretty good for what you're doing
2011-03-19 13:58:13	nadir	ok.
2011-03-19 13:58:25	fsmithred	not that I have any experience with it
2011-03-19 13:58:29	nadir	For me two hours is not very much.
2011-03-19 13:58:43	fsmithred	no, that's about one kernel
2011-03-19 13:58:50	fsmithred	maybe two if you're efficient
2011-03-19 13:59:00	nadir	what? sorry... i am lost.
2011-03-19 13:59:15	nadir	two kernels?
2011-03-19 13:59:17	fsmithred	takes me at least an hour to compile a kernel
2011-03-19 13:59:31	nadir	ah. kernel compiling goes through in the blink of an eye.
2011-03-19 13:59:32	fsmithred	a lot of that time is figuring out wtf I'm doing
2011-03-19 13:59:33	nadir	dual core.
2011-03-19 13:59:46	nadir	I usually do "localmodconfig"
2011-03-19 13:59:49	nadir	boot into that one.
2011-03-19 13:59:59	fsmithred	I think it runs for about 20 min here on dual core
2011-03-19 13:59:59	nadir	search for the errors. correct them. done.
2011-03-19 14:00:06	nadir	yes, like what you say.
2011-03-19 14:00:28	nadir	I did a lot of kernel compilations in VBox, so i am used to veeeery long builds.
2011-03-19 14:00:43	fsmithred	wow
2011-03-19 14:00:58	nadir	now i start, browse the web or chat a bit.
2011-03-19 14:01:03	nadir	and it is done. thats great.
2011-03-19 14:01:11	nadir	dual-core seems to be good.
2011-03-19 14:01:22	nadir	ah, i also picked 64.
2011-03-19 14:01:40	fsmithred	what's gonna happen if I move my github directory to a different location?
2011-03-19 14:01:51	fsmithred	does it care where it is?
2011-03-19 14:02:02	nadir	i don't think so. but i don't know
2011-03-19 14:02:12	fsmithred	guess I'll copy it and find out
2011-03-19 14:02:20	nadir	perhaps ping telemachus
2011-03-19 14:02:30	nadir	(did that by a trick :-)
2011-03-19 14:02:36	@telemachus	pong
2011-03-19 14:02:42	fsmithred	it worked
2011-03-19 14:02:45	nadir	leck arsch, bin ich gut.
2011-03-19 14:03:02	fsmithred	what' happens if I move my github directory?
2011-03-19 14:03:08	@telemachus	I'm not sure I want to translate "leck arsch"
2011-03-19 14:03:08	@telemachus	eek
2011-03-19 14:03:13	@telemachus	fsmithred: Nada
2011-03-19 14:03:17	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-19 14:03:19	nadir	correct translation is damn.
2011-03-19 14:03:28	@telemachus	Git stores all its working stuff in "folder/.git"
2011-03-19 14:03:39	@telemachus	as long as "folder/.git" is preserved, all is good
2011-03-19 14:03:52	@telemachus	so just make sure you copy everything (not just the visible)
2011-03-19 14:03:54	fsmithred	heh
2011-03-19 14:03:59	fsmithred	git add blah
2011-03-19 14:04:00	nadir	git clone file -> would work too, no?
2011-03-19 14:04:02	fsmithred	command not found
2011-03-19 14:04:08	fsmithred	guess I have to install it
2011-03-19 14:04:18	fsmithred	oh nadir, about that xfce build
2011-03-19 14:04:19	@telemachus	nadir: Right, you could also always reinstall
2011-03-19 14:04:24	fsmithred	bzip2 might be missing
2011-03-19 14:04:36	nadir	the iso you send me?
2011-03-19 14:04:56	fsmithred	yeah, well you had to build it yourself, right?
2011-03-19 14:05:06	nadir	puh.
2011-03-19 14:05:12	nadir	i don't remember.
2011-03-19 14:05:17	nadir	i install stuff as i run into it.
2011-03-19 14:05:21	nadir	shall i check?
2011-03-19 14:05:22	fsmithred	the iso you downloaded from me was refracta
2011-03-19 14:05:26	nadir	no
2011-03-19 14:05:32	nadir	ah..
2011-03-19 14:05:41	nadir	yes, you gave me commands, not an iso. right?
2011-03-19 14:05:49	fsmithred	I sent you the config command and the skel
2011-03-19 14:05:52	nadir	live-helper commands.
2011-03-19 14:05:54	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-19 14:05:56	nadir	yes. ok. i remember.
2011-03-19 14:06:03	nadir	shall i check?
2011-03-19 14:06:11	fsmithred	omg, you're as bad as I am
2011-03-19 14:06:22	fsmithred	we better keep good notes
2011-03-19 14:06:30	nadir	puh.
2011-03-19 14:06:37	nadir	git?
2011-03-19 14:06:52	nadir	but then one is lost in git. Not sure if that is a solution.
2011-03-19 14:07:16	fsmithred	no, I mean on the refracta project
2011-03-19 14:07:30	nadir	yes.
2011-03-19 14:07:32	nadir	i know
2011-03-19 14:08:02	nadir	...
2011-03-19 14:08:07	nadir	As you know i am a forum guy.
2011-03-19 14:08:22	nadir	Putting info in a forum is ok for me. Not sure if it is that way for you too.
2011-03-19 14:09:04	fsmithred	that might be ok
2011-03-19 14:09:24	nadir	I save the forum daily.
2011-03-19 14:09:25	fsmithred	except for all our trade secrets
2011-03-19 14:09:28	nadir	more or less.
2011-03-19 14:09:37	nadir	ah, you mean the $$$ ?
2011-03-19 14:10:34	fsmithred	y
2011-03-19 14:11:17	nadir	good.
2011-03-19 14:11:23	nadir	that shall be kept secret.
2011-03-19 14:11:48	nadir	Like said, (serious now):
2011-03-19 14:12:02	nadir	i don't feel very well about the whole thing right now.
2011-03-19 14:12:16	nadir	I don't say i am out or so.
2011-03-19 14:12:20	nadir	I even got some ideas.
2011-03-19 14:12:27	nadir	But it feels very, very strange.
2011-03-19 14:12:35	fsmithred	yeah, I agree
2011-03-19 14:12:37	nadir	is that kinda understandable?
2011-03-19 14:12:40	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-03-19 14:13:00	fsmithred	I accept the fact that we don't get to choose what he does
2011-03-19 14:13:15	nadir	yes, but that is now very strange.
2011-03-19 14:13:22	nadir	I have seen lots of strange things happen.
2011-03-19 14:13:26	nadir	But now i am shocked.
2011-03-19 14:13:35	fsmithred	I predict that he will still be involved
2011-03-19 14:13:45	nadir	Uhum.
2011-03-19 14:13:46	fsmithred	off and on, like he usually is
2011-03-19 14:13:50	nadir	lol.
2011-03-19 14:13:51	nadir	yes.
2011-03-19 14:13:56	fsmithred	but the project itself will be more stable
2011-03-19 14:13:58	@telemachus	https://github.com/telemachus/perl-exercises
2011-03-19 14:14:00	@telemachus	Finally
2011-03-19 14:14:04	nadir	I got two proposals:
2011-03-19 14:14:07	nadir	thanks telemachus
2011-03-19 14:14:16	fsmithred	is that our homework?
2011-03-19 14:14:20	nadir	a) lets keep the actual version downloadable.
2011-03-19 14:14:30	nadir	as a fallback. so to speak.
2011-03-19 14:14:32	fsmithred	yeah, I'm not going to move that iso
2011-03-19 14:14:45	nadir	b) ... mhhh...
2011-03-19 14:14:53	nadir	if i was you i would add his name to the team.
2011-03-19 14:14:57	nadir	if he wants it or not.
2011-03-19 14:15:06	nadir	delicate, i know.
2011-03-19 14:15:08	@telemachus	nadir: It's examples for chapter 6
2011-03-19 14:15:12	nadir	but he does what he wants too.
2011-03-19 14:15:17	@telemachus	like when they say, you can find an example is 'hash.pl'
2011-03-19 14:15:19	nadir	let me check.
2011-03-19 14:15:21	@telemachus	I wrote an example
2011-03-19 14:15:28	@telemachus	but I removed all the .pl from the names
2011-03-19 14:15:32	@telemachus	Actually, I have to run
2011-03-19 14:15:35	@telemachus	back later
2011-03-19 14:15:36	fsmithred	thanks, tele
2011-03-19 14:15:42	fsmithred	ok, see you later
2011-03-19 14:16:00	nadir	ah, bye, and thanks.
2011-03-19 14:16:10	fsmithred	nadir, when I took over the sourceforge account
2011-03-19 14:16:30	fsmithred	and put myself as project leader, and removed his name, just as he requsted
2011-03-19 14:16:41	fsmithred	I loaded the page, and it said...
2011-03-19 14:16:47	fsmithred	refracta by fsmithred
2011-03-19 14:16:55	fsmithred	so I edited it
2011-03-19 14:17:12	fsmithred	where he's written 'closed' in the description
2011-03-19 14:17:27	fsmithred	I replaced closed with gestating
2011-03-19 14:17:30	fsmithred	and
2011-03-19 14:17:41	fsmithred	refracta by deanlinkous has a new project manager
2011-03-19 14:17:59	fsmithred	that's all I am
2011-03-19 14:18:02	fsmithred	it's still his baby
2011-03-19 14:18:16	nadir	ah, sourceforge?
2011-03-19 14:18:21	fsmithred	y
2011-03-19 14:19:02	nadir	ok, i found it.
2011-03-19 14:19:07	fsmithred	I don't think there's anything there except links
2011-03-19 14:19:11	nadir	what means "gestating" ?
2011-03-19 14:19:17	fsmithred	like...
2011-03-19 14:19:19	fsmithred	pregnant
2011-03-19 14:19:23	nadir	lol.
2011-03-19 14:19:27	fsmithred	fetal development
2011-03-19 14:19:33	nadir	sounds like a word from the netherlands.
2011-03-19 14:19:44	fsmithred	might be
2011-03-19 14:20:08	fsmithred	probably from latin, though
2011-03-19 14:22:34	nadir	but you ain't got access to ilibilio (spelling?) ?
2011-03-19 14:22:40	fsmithred	yeah
2011-03-19 14:22:57	fsmithred	I haven't changed the password, though
2011-03-19 14:22:58	nadir	damn. i asked wrong. You got access, yes or no?
2011-03-19 14:23:02	nadir	ah, you got. ok.
2011-03-19 14:23:14	fsmithred	so there's still a risk that he could purge
2011-03-19 14:23:31	nadir	Worse than a mad dog.
2011-03-19 14:23:35	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 14:23:36	nadir	He kills me.
2011-03-19 14:23:52	nadir	But, otoh: that was always one of the fun things too.
2011-03-19 14:23:53	fsmithred	I'm glad you have that archive
2011-03-19 14:23:57	nadir	yes.
2011-03-19 14:24:06	nadir	I got it on hard-disk and at adrive.
2011-03-19 14:24:10	nadir	It seems to be sane.
2011-03-19 14:24:23	nadir	I also got old icewm-configs, in case we would want that.
2011-03-19 14:24:39	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-19 14:24:42	fsmithred	maybe
2011-03-19 14:24:44	nadir	and a heck lot of Deans artwork.
2011-03-19 14:24:57	fsmithred	one thing I'm thinking about is a swiss-army-knife version
2011-03-19 14:24:58	nadir	I could even give you the passwd for adrive.
2011-03-19 14:25:05	nadir	swiss: cool.
2011-03-19 14:25:09	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 14:25:13	fsmithred	lots of utilities
2011-03-19 14:25:23	fsmithred	for rescue and repair
2011-03-19 14:25:33	fsmithred	not that there aren't enough of those out there already
2011-03-19 14:25:34	nadir	i added a lot to my remix-refracta version.
2011-03-19 14:25:45	fsmithred	heh...
2011-03-19 14:25:47	nadir	but you gave me all the utilties, so most of them you should know
2011-03-19 14:25:58	fsmithred	I checked at distrowatch to see what it takes to get listed
2011-03-19 14:26:07	fsmithred	they have a waiting list of 239 distros
2011-03-19 14:26:13	nadir	lol
2011-03-19 14:26:18	fsmithred	oldest one dates back to 2004
2011-03-19 14:26:26	fsmithred	most are in the last 2 years
2011-03-19 14:26:29	nadir	ubuntu with 238 different wallpapers?
2011-03-19 14:26:41	fsmithred	I checked a few
2011-03-19 14:26:48	fsmithred	and if I got a true random sample
2011-03-19 14:26:54	fsmithred	a lot of them are based on buntu
2011-03-19 14:27:19	fsmithred	one or two on fedora
2011-03-19 14:27:24	fsmithred	didn't run into any debians
2011-03-19 14:27:31	nadir	lots of refracta releases had a nice choice of apps.
2011-03-19 14:27:35	fsmithred	but I only checked about half a dozen
2011-03-19 14:27:45	nadir	not so very well known stuff, but easy enough.
2011-03-19 14:27:51	fsmithred	other way to get listed, right away, is to buy an ad for $200
2011-03-19 14:28:04	nadir	aha.
2011-03-19 14:28:50	fsmithred	but for free, you have to survive long enough to prove your worth
2011-03-19 14:29:20	nadir	what is your usual desktop, btw?
2011-03-19 14:29:24	fsmithred	xfce
2011-03-19 14:29:28	nadir	good.
2011-03-19 14:29:35	nadir	i did not know for sure.
2011-03-19 14:29:43	fsmithred	you know what jheaton and traveler use?
2011-03-19 14:29:53	nadir	jheaton spoke about icewm short ago.
2011-03-19 14:30:00	nadir	traveler seems to jump a lot.
2011-03-19 14:30:28	nadir	mhh... some tiling manager for a while (the same like debil)
2011-03-19 14:30:33	nadir	right now i don't know.
2011-03-19 14:31:03	nadir	If you ever got an itching you should have a look at my remix.
2011-03-19 14:31:04	fsmithred	I used icewm in the past
2011-03-19 14:31:14	fsmithred	is it up on adrive?
2011-03-19 14:31:24	nadir	Bro.Tiag has it got hosted too.
2011-03-19 14:31:31	nadir	but it is also on adrive.
2011-03-19 14:31:33	fsmithred	cool
2011-03-19 14:31:37	nadir	and now i got a sid version.
2011-03-19 14:31:38	fsmithred	I can try it soon
2011-03-19 14:32:00	fsmithred	still got a lot of installing and configuring to do
2011-03-19 14:32:06	fsmithred	or reboot to the old system
2011-03-19 14:32:13	nadir	what i really like is bookmarks.
2011-03-19 14:32:25	fsmithred	yeah, I put bookmarks in my build
2011-03-19 14:32:26	nadir	at least some basic ones.
2011-03-19 14:32:32	fsmithred	facebook?
2011-03-19 14:32:34	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 14:32:41	nadir	especially facebook.
2011-03-19 14:32:46	fsmithred	probably should be in the aunt martha edition
2011-03-19 14:33:00	fsmithred	I actually serious about that
2011-03-19 14:33:08	fsmithred	I never touch the shit
2011-03-19 14:33:14	fsmithred	but it's very popular
2011-03-19 14:33:24	fsmithred	pretty sure I included youtube
2011-03-19 14:33:31	nadir	one of the tons of things i ain't got no clue about.
2011-03-19 14:33:37	fsmithred	same here
2011-03-19 14:33:37	nadir	yes, youtube is good.
2011-03-19 14:33:49	nadir	try if you can save that link:
2011-03-19 14:33:53	nadir	http://debe17.com/iso/remix-refracta-squeeze.iso
2011-03-19 14:34:53	nadir	it will try to download, not sure how i made the bookmark
2011-03-19 14:36:05	fsmithred	I put the link in a text file for now
2011-03-19 14:36:16	fsmithred	you might have edited bookmark by hand
2011-03-19 14:36:34	nadir	i fiddled around a bit, but can't remember.
2011-03-19 14:36:38	nadir	else just ask again.
2011-03-19 14:36:48	nadir	It is a version for me. Not completely configured or so.
2011-03-19 14:36:50	nadir	Say:
2011-03-19 14:36:56	@telemachus	Updated Debian 6.0: 6.0.1 released
2011-03-19 14:37:12	@telemachus	On the mailing list
2011-03-19 14:37:16	nadir	i open geany with a wee bit of info, instead of using desktop icons like you got. which is more sexy.
2011-03-19 14:37:21	nadir	telemachus, that was fast.
2011-03-19 14:37:35	nadir	feels like 6.0 just got released.
2011-03-19 14:37:49	@telemachus	Yup
2011-03-19 14:38:02	@telemachus	looks to be mostly just little security things
2011-03-19 14:38:10	@telemachus	if you get security updates, it may be nothing new even
2011-03-19 14:38:22	nadir	i am subscribed to securtiy, and i have not seen that much of things....
2011-03-19 14:38:24	fsmithred	I upgrade pretty regularly
2011-03-19 14:38:54	fsmithred	ok, I just changed the ibiblio password
2011-03-19 14:39:21	nadir	does that mean we are save from Mr.MeanMadDogDean ?
2011-03-19 14:39:21	fsmithred	refracta-6.0.3 will probably be there for years
2011-03-19 14:39:30	@telemachus	Btw, I apologize, but I only did exercises for 6 so far. I could do 7, but almost certainly not by tomorrow.
2011-03-19 14:39:31	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-19 14:39:41	fsmithred	that's ok, tele
2011-03-19 14:39:42	nadir	that is already a lot.
2011-03-19 14:39:45	fsmithred	I haven't done the homework yet
2011-03-19 14:39:48	@telemachus	Going forward I'll try to do them in advance - this week was bad.
2011-03-19 14:39:54	nadir	huh? homework?
2011-03-19 14:40:08	fsmithred	there are exercises in chap 6 and 7
2011-03-19 14:40:09	@telemachus	nadir: Heh - I think he just means the exercises for the chapters
2011-03-19 14:40:13	@telemachus	that
2011-03-19 14:40:21	nadir	the exercises are easy, i think.
2011-03-19 14:40:31	nadir	i am quite sure that most i did.
2011-03-19 14:40:32	fsmithred	some of what I was reading
2011-03-19 14:40:38	fsmithred	I think I already did them
2011-03-19 14:40:41	@telemachus	most are pretty easy, yeah
2011-03-19 14:40:42	fsmithred	but I can't find what I wrote
2011-03-19 14:40:49	nadir	tell me about it.
2011-03-19 14:40:58	@telemachus	for future chapters, I will probably assign larger mini-projects
2011-03-19 14:41:10	fsmithred	that would be cool
2011-03-19 14:41:17	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-19 14:41:22	@telemachus	Agreed
2011-03-19 14:41:39	@telemachus	Within a few chapters, things should get more interesting again.
2011-03-19 14:42:56	@telemachus	8 is conditions, 9 is subroutines
2011-03-19 14:43:02	@telemachus	after that, we can build bigger things
2011-03-19 14:44:47	nadir	my favorite is:
2011-03-19 14:45:05	nadir	sub p_b { say "\n BREAK\n\n" }
2011-03-19 14:45:20	fsmithred	???
2011-03-19 14:45:23	nadir	favorite means: the only one.
2011-03-19 14:45:31	nadir	to format the output.
2011-03-19 14:45:46	nadir	mhh.... not sure if i can explain it.
2011-03-19 14:45:55	nadir	i got an array, and print it.
2011-03-19 14:46:00	nadir	i change the array.
2011-03-19 14:46:12	nadir	before i printit again, to test if my change worked, i do:
2011-03-19 14:46:15	nadir	p_b()
2011-03-19 14:46:21	nadir	and i see a big fat:
2011-03-19 14:46:22	nadir	BREAK
2011-03-19 14:46:25	nadir	on the screen.
2011-03-19 14:46:38	nadir	So i can easily distinguish version one with version 2
2011-03-19 14:46:42	nadir	ok?
2011-03-19 14:47:04	fsmithred	yup
2011-03-19 14:47:04	nadir	ah: p_b -> print_break.
2011-03-19 14:49:17	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-19 14:49:30	@telemachus	Soon I will teach you about Data::Dump and Data::Dumper
2011-03-19 14:49:39	@telemachus	better ways to view what's in variables and when
2011-03-19 14:50:00	nadir	instead of print?
2011-03-19 14:50:05	@telemachus	Oh, also, I came across something you both may be interested in.
2011-03-19 14:50:16	@telemachus	nadir: It prints but in a better way - more clear
2011-03-19 14:50:21	nadir	ah,ok.
2011-03-19 14:51:19	@telemachus	TAP is a Perl-style of testing programs (stands for test anything protocol - silly name)
2011-03-19 14:51:27	@telemachus	Someone wrote a version of it for Bash: http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Tap-functions
2011-03-19 14:51:48	@telemachus	I like the look of it - will probably try it the next time I write something larger in Bash
2011-03-19 14:52:05	@telemachus	Source code is here http://svn.solucorp.qc.ca/repos/solucorp/JTap/trunk/tap-functions
2011-03-19 14:53:24	nadir	ok.
2011-03-19 14:53:33	nadir	will it check only bash, or any code?
2011-03-19 14:53:44	fsmithred	I just read the documentation, and I'm lost
2011-03-19 14:53:47	nadir	and i read something about a perl-code checker.
2011-03-19 14:53:52	nadir	fsmithred, +1
2011-03-19 14:54:21	fsmithred	I just write in my own tests as I go along
2011-03-19 14:54:33	nadir	TAP started life as part of the test harness for Perl but now has implementations in C, C++, Python, PHP, Perl, Java and others.
2011-03-19 14:54:36	fsmithred	usually just echo something to screen, so I can see how far the script ran
2011-03-19 14:54:41	nadir	so far i am clear now.
2011-03-19 14:54:46	fsmithred	sometimes echo specific variables
2011-03-19 14:54:52	nadir	exactly. echo. i love it.
2011-03-19 14:55:33	nadir	well: i love anything which does at minimum something.
2011-03-19 14:55:35	fsmithred	if I could figure out how to get geany to test my syntax for missing brackets and the like, I'd be really happy
2011-03-19 14:56:58	nadir	but it has got syntax highlighting, no?
2011-03-19 14:57:05	fsmithred	yes
2011-03-19 14:57:17	nadir	in vim, if i go on the opening bracket it shows me the closing one.
2011-03-19 14:57:27	nadir	also: %
2011-03-19 14:57:28	fsmithred	don't know if I can do that in geany
2011-03-19 14:57:38	nadir	will jump to the fitting bracket.
2011-03-19 14:57:45	nadir	which is cool.
2011-03-19 14:57:55	fsmithred	also, stuff like no space around the "=" in a test
2011-03-19 14:58:02	nadir	i use geany as a notebook, so i sure don't know.
2011-03-19 14:58:04	fsmithred	or other little error
2011-03-19 14:58:44	nadir	you use a bright background?
2011-03-19 14:58:58	nadir	for me a black one makes it much easier to see such things.
2011-03-19 14:59:09	nadir	(i see that your main point is a different one)
2011-03-19 14:59:26	@telemachus	hmm
2011-03-19 14:59:27	@telemachus	ok
2011-03-19 14:59:44	@telemachus	I grant that it may be confusing at first - the whole idea of testing and that stuff in particular.
2011-03-19 14:59:52	@telemachus	I was thinking at some point to introduce it all.
2011-03-19 14:59:59	@telemachus	Maybe I jumped the gun.
2011-03-19 15:00:07	nadir	nah.
2011-03-19 15:00:35	@telemachus	In a nutshell, you do something like this: I need to write a program. In the program, I need a function to add two numbers. I could just write it and be done.
2011-03-19 15:00:53	@telemachus	But another way to do it is write tests for it also (tests can come first or after - different styles).
2011-03-19 15:01:08	@telemachus	The tests make sure that the function behaves as you expect it to.
2011-03-19 15:01:30	@telemachus	Example: ok(add(1,2), 3), "1 + 2 = 3"
2011-03-19 15:01:42	@telemachus	the ok function tests what's inside it
2011-03-19 15:01:46	@telemachus	first thing is your function
2011-03-19 15:01:52	@telemachus	second thing is expected value
2011-03-19 15:01:58	@telemachus	third thing is a message to print
2011-03-19 15:04:00	nadir	which means to purge some common errors per se?
2011-03-19 15:04:07	nadir	like that?
2011-03-19 15:04:37	@telemachus	Yes, but in bigger cases it has a bunch of other values.
2011-03-19 15:05:08	@telemachus	Like, you can test edges - what if you get too few params? what if you get too many? Does it work on zero? Negative numbers, etc.
2011-03-19 15:05:26	@telemachus	Also, and maybe most importantly, it allows you to rework code with more confidence.
2011-03-19 15:05:32	@telemachus	Imagine you have a 1000 line program.
2011-03-19 15:06:04	@telemachus	And you want to improve something. If you have tests, you can run them as you rework to see exactly when and where something breaks.
2011-03-19 15:06:08	@telemachus	That can be useful
2011-03-19 15:06:34	@telemachus	btw, I misdescribed the simplest ok() function
2011-03-19 15:06:53	@telemachus	it should be this: ok(add(1,2) == 3, '1 + 2 = 3')
2011-03-19 15:06:57	@telemachus	two params only
2011-03-19 15:07:10	@telemachus	first is a test if it's true, ok is happy, second is a message
2011-03-19 15:07:56	fsmithred	I need to run down to the corner store - I'll be back in 10 min.
2011-03-19 15:08:00	nadir	i am quite sure that i read about a gnu-tool to visualize debugging, but i can't find it anymore.
2011-03-19 15:08:05	nadir	wait, fsmithred
2011-03-19 15:08:07	@telemachus	np, I'll be gone soon though
2011-03-19 15:08:10	nadir	i will need to eat.
2011-03-19 15:08:12	fsmithred	ok
2011-03-19 15:08:12	@telemachus	so later, fsmithred
2011-03-19 15:08:33	@telemachus	both of you, check this later maybe https://gist.github.com/877716
2011-03-19 15:08:38	fsmithred	yes, eat - that's what I'm thinking about
2011-03-19 15:08:41	@telemachus	A mini Perl test script one pass, one fail
2011-03-19 15:08:45	@telemachus	to see the output
2011-03-19 15:08:55	@telemachus	see you both tomorrow
2011-03-19 15:08:57	nadir	thanks, a) for the code and b) for the eat.
2011-03-19 15:09:22	nadir	perhaps i will be here later. right now i am only tired and hungry...
2011-03-19 15:09:24	nadir	ok?
2011-03-19 15:09:41	fsmithred	yeah, ok
2011-03-19 15:09:51	fsmithred	see you tomorrow, tele

2011-03-19 18:57:09	@telemachus	It's in that thread.
2011-03-19 18:57:17	@telemachus	I mentioned to them that some of us had no idea.
2011-03-19 18:57:27	@telemachus	If you care, you may want to accept or say no thanks.
2011-03-19 18:58:35	fsmithred	yeah, dean did it
2011-03-19 18:58:39	fsmithred	I just found it
2011-03-19 18:58:50	fsmithred	geez
2011-03-19 18:58:59	fsmithred	it's a bad time for me to take on anything like that
2011-03-19 18:59:11	fsmithred	I have to be out of my apartment by the end of may

2011-03-19 18:59:33	@telemachus	I'm sorry to hear that.
2011-03-19 18:59:39	@telemachus	More?
2011-03-19 18:59:42	fsmithred	need to find a new office, too
2011-03-19 18:59:52	fsmithred	and need to find at least a part time job
2011-03-19 19:00:48	fsmithred	I'll spare you all the gory details, but I haven't exactly been working hard at making money
2011-03-19 19:02:10	fsmithred	don't tell anyone, but I do have some admin experience on another board
2011-03-19 19:02:11	fsmithred	lol
2011-03-19 19:02:34	@telemachus	I won't give you up.
2011-03-19 19:02:48	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-19 19:02:57	fsmithred	I might have already mentioned it to dean
2011-03-19 19:03:09	@telemachus	And I am sorry about all the moving and such.
2011-03-19 19:03:13	fsmithred	thanks
2011-03-19 19:03:40	fsmithred	one perk out of all this is that I don't have to worry about identity theft
2011-03-19 19:04:12	@telemachus	How so?

2011-03-19 19:06:35	@telemachus	Feel free to tell me to fuck off and mind my own business.
2011-03-19 19:06:52	fsmithred	I could maybe get work in a clinical lab
2011-03-19 19:07:02	fsmithred	used to do that
2011-03-19 19:07:33	fsmithred	and might be able to get entry level position in linux system admin
2011-03-19 19:08:21	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-19 19:08:26	fsmithred	friend of mine is supposed to give me names of temp companies in the area that I can check out
2011-03-19 19:08:35	@telemachus	Cool
2011-03-19 19:08:43	fsmithred	she says they would test me and figure out what I could do
2011-03-19 19:09:11	@telemachus	I would imagine that could go pretty well.

2011-03-19 19:11:29	fsmithred	I've been told that I know more than kids coming out of school with cs degree
2011-03-19 19:11:56	fsmithred	that's from a friend whose son just graduated a couple years ago
2011-03-19 19:18:46	fsmithred	you teach high school or college?
2011-03-19 19:19:59	@telemachus	Sorry, back
2011-03-19 19:20:10	@telemachus	And yea, you certainly know more than most CS kids
2011-03-19 19:20:19	@telemachus	You have real programming/systems experience
2011-03-19 19:20:24	@telemachus	I teach high school
2011-03-19 19:20:35	@telemachus	don't you remember? All girls Catholic school - nadir lost it.
2011-03-19 19:20:43	fsmithred	yeah, I remember that part
2011-03-19 19:20:50	fsmithred	but wasn't sure what level
2011-03-19 19:21:03	fsmithred	I'll bet you're one of the teachers they remember
2011-03-19 19:21:23	fsmithred	remember good things, I mean
2011-03-19 19:22:14	@telemachus	Heh - probably some of both, but thanks.

2011-03-30 09:39:47	nadir	moin too, at all.
2011-03-30 09:41:12	nadir	telemachus, if you got time, you are good with networking?
2011-03-30 09:41:21	nadir	me thinks you said such at your blog.
2011-03-30 09:41:33	nadir	(that you want to read about it)
2011-03-30 09:41:44	@telemachus	I am not so good with networking
2011-03-30 09:41:56	@telemachus	Go ahead and ask - we'll see
2011-03-30 09:42:08	nadir	no, not a question.
2011-03-30 09:42:19	nadir	I am thinking about perl, and what i would want to do with it.
2011-03-30 09:42:40	nadir	I think in the long run i would like to learn about networks/protocolls/etc
2011-03-30 09:43:03	@telemachus	ah
2011-03-30 09:43:05	@telemachus	gotcha
2011-03-30 09:43:06	@telemachus	cool
2011-03-30 09:43:14	@telemachus	yes, that sounds good to me
2011-03-30 09:43:18	@telemachus	and works nicely with rstat.us
2011-03-30 09:43:22	nadir	it is a heck lot of trouble, and i need a long run goal.
2011-03-30 09:43:25	@telemachus	which is a networked web application
2011-03-30 09:43:30	@telemachus	and I want to write a client for it
2011-03-30 09:43:34	@telemachus	and integrate it with irssi
2011-03-30 09:43:35	nadir	yes. i guess thats why i came to it.
2011-03-30 09:44:03	@telemachus	hmm?
2011-03-30 09:44:05	@telemachus	which is why?
2011-03-30 09:44:16	nadir	you spoke about rstat.us.
2011-03-30 09:44:21	nadir	few days ago.
2011-03-30 09:44:26	@telemachus	ah, ok
2011-03-30 09:44:27	@telemachus	cool
2011-03-30 09:44:39	nadir	i am sure that oyu mention the need to read on protocolls now and then.
2011-03-30 09:45:02	nadir	i guess i am very naive.
2011-03-30 09:45:24	nadir	for me it is _very_ hard stuff. Not sure if i ever will get anywhere (with networking).
2011-03-30 09:45:58	@telemachus	no, it's complicated
2011-03-30 09:46:00	nadir	for now its perl-basics anyway.
2011-03-30 09:46:05	@telemachus	no reason to feel bad about that
2011-03-30 09:46:08	nadir	but it is good to have "a goal"
2011-03-30 09:46:14	nadir	thanks.
2011-03-30 09:46:49	@telemachus	It's funny - I'm actually looking at the rstat.us code now
2011-03-30 09:46:58	@telemachus	Trying to fix something/contribute
2011-03-30 09:47:00	@telemachus	we'll see
2011-03-30 09:47:13	nadir	and there comes the problem: ruby. argh...
2011-03-30 09:47:30	nadir	i am always inside of my little knowledge.
2011-03-30 09:47:33	nadir	:-)
2011-03-30 09:48:00	@telemachus	no worries
2011-03-30 09:48:05	@telemachus	we'll find a way to contribute from perl
2011-03-30 09:49:24	@telemachus	brb
2011-03-30 09:52:46	@telemachus	ok, back
2011-03-30 09:52:53	@telemachus	how is chapter 8 going?
2011-03-30 09:52:53	nadir	wb
2011-03-30 09:53:00	nadir	i guess ok.
2011-03-30 09:53:11	nadir	the "more than one way" starts to be less confusing.
2011-03-30 09:53:33	@telemachus	good
2011-03-30 09:53:34	nadir	say: (<>) or (<STDIN>)
2011-03-30 09:53:44	nadir	you know it is of the things which make a mad dog out of me,
2011-03-30 09:53:50	nadir	but i seem to get used to it.
2011-03-30 09:54:17	nadir	I am Germanski. We need strict rules, even when destroy a whole continenent... :-)
2011-03-30 09:54:45	@telemachus	heh
2011-03-30 09:55:08	@telemachus	I told you my favorite German-stereotype joke?
2011-03-30 09:55:13	nadir	you know it, right? most argued: "but we did it according to the rules" ?
2011-03-30 09:55:17	nadir	no give it to me.
2011-03-30 09:55:32	@telemachus	(yes, I know the "Just following orders/rules argument")
2011-03-30 09:55:51	@telemachus	ok, American novelist Thomas Pynchon, in his novel Gravity's Rainbow
2011-03-30 09:55:57	@telemachus	book is set during WWII
2011-03-30 09:56:10	@telemachus	two soldiers are arguing about Vivaldi versus Beethoven
2011-03-30 09:56:31	@telemachus	finally one says, "Beethoven - ugh - you listen to him and all you want to do is invade Poland"
2011-03-30 09:56:50	@telemachus	Not sure why but the first time I read it, I laughed so hard I nearly wet myself
2011-03-30 09:56:53	@telemachus	really lost it
2011-03-30 09:56:56	nadir	yup.
2011-03-30 09:57:04	nadir	it is fucking strange.
2011-03-30 09:57:06	@telemachus	(they are in the middle of hellish DMZ, so context may help)
2011-03-30 09:57:19	@telemachus	(also funny - I much prefer B to V)
2011-03-30 09:57:45	nadir	i am loving B, but, honestly, i don't know V at all.
2011-03-30 09:58:02	@telemachus	oh really?
2011-03-30 09:58:12	nadir	really. I am a workers son.
2011-03-30 09:58:17	nadir	i miss a lot of stuff.
2011-03-30 09:58:18	@telemachus	hah
2011-03-30 09:58:33	nadir	some i know, with that i bigmouth, a lot i don't know.
2011-03-30 09:58:33	@telemachus	Ok, let me figure out how/where. I will upload some flacs
2011-03-30 09:58:40	nadir	cool bean.
2011-03-30 09:58:41	@telemachus	V is amazing
2011-03-30 09:58:47	nadir	yes?
2011-03-30 09:58:49	nadir	damn.
2011-03-30 09:58:50	@telemachus	I like especially his string stuff
2011-03-30 09:58:59	@telemachus	just strings - not whole orchestras
2011-03-30 09:59:04	nadir	like in string-tanga, i suppose...
2011-03-30 09:59:10	nadir	me likes them too.
2011-03-30 09:59:14	@telemachus	tanga = bikini?
2011-03-30 09:59:25	nadir	string-tanga, no english word?
2011-03-30 09:59:31	nadir	slip
2011-03-30 09:59:37	nadir	but less than a slip
2011-03-30 09:59:38	@telemachus	tr en en tanga
2011-03-30 09:59:47	@telemachus	yeah, super nothing bikini
2011-03-30 09:59:54	nadir	wait, i got to go for google-pictures...
2011-03-30 09:59:57	@telemachus	not so popular here as in Europe or Brazil
2011-03-30 09:59:58	nadir	yes.
2011-03-30 09:59:59	@telemachus	hey now
2011-03-30 10:00:01	@telemachus	the children
2011-03-30 10:00:02	@telemachus	careful

2011-03-30 10:00:07	nadir	ah,oh, uff.
2011-03-30 10:00:19	@telemachus	(kidding - I don't mind but I do know what it is)
2011-03-30 10:00:21	nadir	The first time i saw it, i thought: now they are finally nut.
2011-03-30 10:00:29	@telemachus	or finally sane
2011-03-30 10:00:37	@telemachus	some of those women should show their ass all the time
2011-03-30 10:00:38	nadir	but i think the hype is over.
2011-03-30 10:00:38	@telemachus	ym
2011-03-30 10:00:40	@telemachus	yum
2011-03-30 10:00:42	@telemachus	anyhow
2011-03-30 10:00:59	@telemachus	by string I mean cello only concertos or string quartets
2011-03-30 10:01:05	@telemachus	not a whole orchestra
2011-03-30 10:01:06	nadir	what a chat: networking -> perl -> GErmnas -> vivaldi -> string-tangas.
2011-03-30 10:01:17	@telemachus	more or less normal for me, I think
2011-03-30 10:01:43	nadir	there is a German word i love, but i don't think you got it:
2011-03-30 10:01:47	nadir	Ideenflucht.
2011-03-30 10:01:52	nadir	Ideen -> ideas.
2011-03-30 10:01:59	nadir	flucht -> run and hide.
2011-03-30 10:02:12	nadir	!tr de en Ideenflucht
2011-03-30 10:02:12	@antinoos	Flight of ideas
2011-03-30 10:02:18	nadir	exists?
2011-03-30 10:02:44	@telemachus	not as such
2011-03-30 10:02:55	@telemachus	flow of ideas we say sometiems
2011-03-30 10:02:58	@telemachus	grr
2011-03-30 10:03:00	nadir	i love it.. it sounds nice.
2011-03-30 10:03:14	nadir	it is said to be a disease, i call it genious.
2011-03-30 10:03:22	nadir	connect things.
2011-03-30 10:03:31	nadir	like a spider.
2011-03-30 10:03:44	nadir	create  a world.
2011-03-30 10:03:54	 *	telemachus nods
2011-03-30 10:03:56	@telemachus	nice image
2011-03-30 10:04:01	@telemachus	I think you've used that before
2011-03-30 10:04:03	nadir	(oh noze, the German get his romantic moments...)
2011-03-30 10:04:11	nadir	yes, it is one of my loved words.
2011-03-30 10:04:12	@telemachus	feel like I heard it from you before at least
2011-03-30 10:04:13	@telemachus	deja vu
2011-03-30 10:04:17	@telemachus	no, I mean the spider
2011-03-30 10:04:21	nadir	yes?
2011-03-30 10:04:24	nadir	strange.
2011-03-30 10:04:25	@telemachus	yah
2011-03-30 10:04:40	@telemachus	ok, no offense - I am here but not here for a while
2011-03-30 10:04:41	nadir	Nietzsche calls Kant the spider.
2011-03-30 10:04:45	@telemachus	must hack on rstat.us
2011-03-30 10:04:51	nadir	if you ever run across Zaratusthra.

2011-03-30 10:04:58	nadir	np, i need to go buy some food.

2011-05-07 13:58:12	fsmithred	tried -c freenode.net, but that didn't work
2011-05-07 13:58:17	fsmithred	hi dbbolton

2011-05-07 13:58:39	fsmithred	and then join this room?

2011-05-07 14:31:11	nadir	fsmithred, did you do perl this week?
2011-05-07 14:31:17	fsmithred	no
2011-05-07 14:31:21	fsmithred	none at all
2011-05-07 14:31:36	nadir	good. i read the object-chapter.
2011-05-07 14:31:41	nadir	and moved on with references.
2011-05-07 14:31:56	fsmithred	any luck with it?
2011-05-07 14:31:58	nadir	for me the next chapter, after objects, makes it a bit clearer.
2011-05-07 14:32:05	nadir	yes, a bit.
2011-05-07 14:32:20	nadir	My actual problem is that it is so overwhelming much.
2011-05-07 14:32:37	nadir	What i do i understand, at least a part.
2011-05-07 14:32:47	nadir	But i feel lost in an ocean of possibilities.
2011-05-07 14:40:36	fsmithred	just booted new iso
2011-05-07 14:40:44	fsmithred	default kernel is the default
2011-05-07 14:41:00	fsmithred	custom kernel is in /boot
2011-05-07 14:42:23	nadir	and does the custom kernel boot?
2011-05-07 14:43:00	fsmithred	trying to figure out how to specify that
2011-05-07 14:43:10	nadir	ah.
2011-05-07 14:49:50	fsmithred	no luck
2011-05-07 14:50:05	nadir	i usually simply remove the stock kernel.
2011-05-07 14:50:30	fsmithred	yeah, that might work
2011-05-07 14:50:40	nadir	wait.
2011-05-07 14:50:49	nadir	and then live-helper adds it again..
2011-05-07 14:51:03	fsmithred	shit
2011-05-07 14:51:03	nadir	then you told me about /vmlinux and /yada-yada
2011-05-07 14:51:11	nadir	i double checked that.
2011-05-07 14:51:24	nadir	but it was done automatically.
2011-05-07 14:51:31	fsmithred	yeah, this was a new build
2011-05-07 14:51:39	fsmithred	not from an existing installation
2011-05-07 14:51:48	fsmithred	no way to remove it
2011-05-07 14:51:59	fsmithred	but I think snapshot should work
2011-05-07 14:52:05	nadir	i used snapshot.
2011-05-07 14:52:14	nadir	and had the new kernel. I checked.
2011-05-07 14:52:15	fsmithred	live-build doesn't get involved
2011-05-07 14:52:24	fsmithred	and it still added stock kernel?
2011-05-07 14:52:36	nadir	sorry, this time i did not check for that.
2011-05-07 14:52:40	nadir	i don't think so.
2011-05-07 14:52:51	nadir	but live-helper does.
2011-05-07 14:53:10	nadir	all as far i can tell, no need to stress that.
2011-05-07 14:53:56	fsmithred	on the bootstrap copy, it added 486 kernel
2011-05-07 14:54:03	fsmithred	and that's the one that boots
2011-05-07 14:54:11	fsmithred	but at least 686 appears in the boot list
2011-05-07 14:58:09	nadir	sorry, i got to eat.
2011-05-07 14:58:17	nadir	else i will fall of the chair.
2011-05-07 14:59:21	nadir	fsmithred, you hear me?
2011-05-07 14:59:52	fsmithred	ok
2011-05-07 14:59:57	nadir	ah, good.
2011-05-07 14:59:57	fsmithred	yeah, I was getting some food
2011-05-07 15:00:18	nadir	later i will do a bit of perl, but perhaps check here.
2011-05-07 15:00:21	nadir	else tomorrow.
2011-05-07 15:00:23	nadir	k?
2011-05-07 15:00:29	fsmithred	I'm gonna add backports and 38 kernel and try snapshot
2011-05-07 15:00:33	fsmithred	you coming back?

2011-05-14 16:20:01	fsmithred	hey dbbolton
2011-05-14 16:20:05	nadir	hi
2011-05-14 16:20:08	fsmithred	how's it going?
2011-05-14 16:20:22	dbbolton	all right. what's the word
2011-05-14 16:20:29	fsmithred	systemd
2011-05-14 16:21:19	fsmithred	I heard a talk on it a few days ago, and I'm impressed
2011-05-14 16:21:34	dbbolton	never tried it
2011-05-14 16:22:14	fsmithred	I just tried it in wheezy/sid, and it seems to work
2011-05-14 16:22:46	fsmithred	for once, I'm learning about something that's going to change before it changes
2011-05-14 16:22:54	dbbolton	what is the advantage
2011-05-14 16:23:03	fsmithred	instead of installing and saying "what th fuck?"
2011-05-14 16:23:08	fsmithred	um
2011-05-14 16:23:10	fsmithred	faster boot
2011-05-14 16:23:16	fsmithred	automount
2011-05-14 16:23:19	fsmithred	not sure what else
2011-05-14 16:23:25	fsmithred	probably lots of other cool things
2011-05-14 16:23:35	fsmithred	I don't reboot or unmount, so...
2011-05-14 16:23:51	fsmithred	it's not really any different
2011-05-14 16:24:16	fsmithred	the other word of the say is streamtuner2
2011-05-14 16:24:43	fsmithred	day, not say
2011-05-14 16:24:50	fsmithred	damn fingers...
2011-05-14 16:26:33	fsmithred	so, anyway
2011-05-14 16:26:43	fsmithred	next refracta will be built up from a minimal system
2011-05-14 16:26:46	fsmithred	little at a time

2011-05-14 16:27:47	fsmithred	nadir, you got any more software recommendations?
2011-05-14 16:27:56	fsmithred	your last one is a big hit
2011-05-14 16:28:25	nadir	i think i like it, but as of now it is beyond me: xhydra
2011-05-14 16:28:35	fsmithred	what is it?
2011-05-14 16:28:54	nadir	restore user-login and password of net-services like ssh.
2011-05-14 16:29:03	nadir	and the x indicates that its gtk.
2011-05-14 16:29:27	fsmithred	hydra and hydra-gtk
2011-05-14 16:29:31	nadir	yup.
2011-05-14 16:29:50	nadir	i think hydra is in Squeeze, but gtk is only in Wheezy,
2011-05-14 16:29:54	nadir	but its an easy build.
2011-05-14 16:30:08	fsmithred	login cracker?
2011-05-14 16:30:15	fsmithred	that's in the description
2011-05-14 16:30:18	nadir	nah.
2011-05-14 16:30:20	nadir	cracker.
2011-05-14 16:30:25	nadir	what a nasty word.
2011-05-14 16:30:30	nadir	it restores passwords.
2011-05-14 16:30:52	nadir	I can't say i understand such stuff, but i think its interesting.
2011-05-14 16:30:57	nadir	i read about john too.
2011-05-14 16:31:01	nadir	and similar apps.
2011-05-14 16:31:11	fsmithred	Description: Very fast network logon cracker
2011-05-14 16:31:11	fsmithred	 Hydra is a parallized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to
2011-05-14 16:31:11	fsmithred	 attack. New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and very fast.
2011-05-14 16:31:11	fsmithred	
2011-05-14 16:31:11	fsmithred	 This tool gives researchers and security consultants the possiblity to show how

2011-05-14 16:31:14	nadir	the one i understand best of that gang is nmap.
2011-05-14 16:31:43	nadir	" to show how easy"
2011-05-14 16:31:49	nadir	in my ears that is a bad joke.
2011-05-14 16:31:57	fsmithred	lol
2011-05-14 16:31:59	nadir	or i am simply stupid.
2011-05-14 16:32:14	fsmithred	you just don't know the magic incantation
2011-05-14 16:32:19	nadir	but, like said, that is fun stuff.
2011-05-14 16:32:22	nadir	nothing serious.
2011-05-14 16:33:00	nadir	For me the Netgear WG111 was quite impressive.
2011-05-14 16:33:17	nadir	dbbolton, you can use that wireless adapter for 16 out of the box.
2011-05-14 16:33:21	nadir	very good.
2011-05-14 16:33:28	nadir	and free as in freedom.
2011-05-14 16:33:53	nadir	fsmithred, i get a bit better with nmap, but that is all i understand.
2011-05-14 16:34:19	nadir	(still very basic, but at least it does ~something~)
2011-05-14 16:34:38	dbbolton	nice
2011-05-14 16:34:51	nadir	and i learn a bit about ports. of which i don't know much.

2011-06-29 20:00:24	n1adir	i want a hash, and use it to access any info of one line from /etc/passwd.
2011-06-29 20:00:30	n1adir	does that make sense? a bit?
2011-06-29 20:03:15	dbbolton	yeah
2011-06-29 20:04:10	n1adir	thanks to the gods. i am often lost when perling
2011-06-29 20:04:51	@telemachus	my @lines = <$in> can be dangerous if you don't know the file-size
2011-06-29 20:04:52	@antinoos	<nadir/#study-group/2011-06-24> sorry, sunday i will be in the train. i  am on a journey. (iirc we stopped our sessions anyway, right?). See us
2011-06-29 20:04:52	@antinoos	<fsmithred/#study-group/2011-06-28> I killed my perl. Scripts won't run if I try to start them as user, and if I try to start them as root, I get errors, because root is using the older version
2011-06-29 20:04:52	@antinoos	<fsmithred/#study-group/2011-06-28> Can you give me the link for the instructions to install perlbrew? I think I might need to wipe it all out and reinstall.
2011-06-29 20:04:52	@antinoos	<fsmithred/#study-group/2011-06-28> I reintsalled perlbrew and 5.12.3, and all is well again. Nadir had the link.
2011-06-29 20:04:52	@telemachus	http://www.perl.com/pub/2003/11/21/slurp.html
2011-06-29 20:05:07	@telemachus	wow
2011-06-29 20:06:16	n1adir	mhh... but if the file is big, using a loop would not help much, would it?
2011-06-29 20:06:25	@telemachus	n1adir: Yes, it would
2011-06-29 20:06:31	@telemachus	the difference is in memory usage
2011-06-29 20:06:41	n1adir	aha. ok. so i can stick to the long way.
2011-06-29 20:06:51	@telemachus	if you slurp a 5GB file, that whole size 5GB is pulled immediately into one big memory ball
2011-06-29 20:07:05	@telemachus	if you do it in a while loop, it's only one line at a time, a few hundred bytes
2011-06-29 20:07:55	@telemachus	on modern computers, it's usually not a big deal, but log files can become enormous surprisingly quickly
2011-06-29 20:08:45	n1adir	got it. i think
2011-06-29 20:09:04	@telemachus	a file contains information
2011-06-29 20:09:21	@telemachus	a big file requires a ton of memory to hold the info in it - if you try to get it all at once
2011-06-29 20:09:31	@telemachus	like trying to eat an entire hamburger in one bite
2011-06-29 20:09:37	@telemachus	:)
2011-06-29 20:11:20	n1adir	in my case, /etc/passwd, i would be safe to use the short version (i guess).
2011-06-29 20:11:29	n1adir	but i prefer doing the same things the same way.
2011-06-29 20:11:30	@telemachus	yup, agreed
2011-06-29 20:11:44	@telemachus	sorry - agree was for that it was safe
2011-06-29 20:11:49	n1adir	prefer means: i have to to avoid confusion.
2011-06-29 20:11:51	@telemachus	not bad to always do the same either
2011-06-29 20:11:52	@telemachus	yeah
2011-06-29 20:11:54	n1adir	yes, got that.
2011-06-29 20:12:01	dbbolton	n1adir: i'd probably do something like https://gist.github.com/1055330
2011-06-29 20:12:08	n1adir	sec for that.
2011-06-29 20:13:55	dbbolton	pretend like i didn't forget to close() it
2011-06-29 20:14:42	@telemachus	heh - a script that short, I don't always bother myself - can't lie
2011-06-29 20:14:45	n1adir	its a bit above me, to be honest.
2011-06-29 20:15:28	n1adir	why the first if in the while loop (the one with the long regex)?
2011-06-29 20:15:44	@telemachus	to rule out lines that don't have records
2011-06-29 20:15:50	@telemachus	say comments or whatever
2011-06-29 20:15:54	dbbolton	it's an implied match operation
2011-06-29 20:16:33	@telemachus	if (/we see a line matching this pattern/) { then do some shit; }
2011-06-29 20:16:52	n1adir	ah. uff. oh. good.
2011-06-29 20:17:11	n1adir	and why the $val =~ s/yada-yada?
2011-06-29 20:17:15	dbbolton	you could also just use an array slice
2011-06-29 20:17:18	n1adir	replace : with a sapce?
2011-06-29 20:17:20	dbbolton	to get rif of colons
2011-06-29 20:17:23	dbbolton	rid*
2011-06-29 20:17:26	dbbolton	yeah
2011-06-29 20:17:53	n1adir	uhum. good too. last one:
2011-06-29 20:18:04	n1adir	not sure about $1 and $2
2011-06-29 20:18:09	dbbolton	grouping
2011-06-29 20:18:12	n1adir	i read the whole line.
2011-06-29 20:18:23	dbbolton	groups are in parentheses
2011-06-29 20:18:25	n1adir	how... i can't even ask. it is strange.
2011-06-29 20:18:29	@telemachus	/^(\w+):([\w:\/]+)$/
2011-06-29 20:18:33	@telemachus	 /^(\w+):([\w:\/]+)$/
2011-06-29 20:18:39	dbbolton	(\w+) = $1
2011-06-29 20:18:42	@telemachus	$1 will have (\w+)
2011-06-29 20:18:50	dbbolton	([\w:\/]+) = 2
2011-06-29 20:18:56	dbbolton	= $2*
2011-06-29 20:19:00	@telemachus	and $2 ([\w:\/]+)
2011-06-29 20:19:03	n1adir	uhum.
2011-06-29 20:19:14	n1adir	but that are only two matches. what about the rest of the line?
2011-06-29 20:19:18	@telemachus	and we know we _only_ try to play with those if the line matches
2011-06-29 20:19:31	@telemachus	check the regex, it's pretty much the whole line
2011-06-29 20:19:46	n1adir	ah, ok.
2011-06-29 20:19:59	@telemachus	^(\w+):([\w:\/]+)$
2011-06-29 20:20:04	@telemachus	^ start of line
2011-06-29 20:20:11	@telemachus	$ end of line
2011-06-29 20:21:48	n1adir	dbbolton, did you run it? It does not seem to match on my users.
2011-06-29 20:21:57	n1adir	the "real" users.
2011-06-29 20:22:02	n1adir	like me, nadir.
2011-06-29 20:22:19	n1adir	i got a number in my name, in case it matters.
2011-06-29 20:22:31	n1adir	but there are two users without numbers in their names
2011-06-29 20:22:44	dbbolton	i posted my output as a comment on the gist
2011-06-29 20:22:49	n1adir	ah, sec.
2011-06-29 20:24:00	dbbolton	i think numbers count as word chars
2011-06-29 20:24:23	@telemachus	speaking of numbers
2011-06-29 20:24:29	@telemachus	why are you n1adir not nadir?
2011-06-29 20:24:38	n1adir	someone is nadir.
2011-06-29 20:24:45	n1adir	i can't change the nick.
2011-06-29 20:26:33	n1adir	still no clue why i don't get no users. but its a good example script anyway.
2011-06-29 20:27:00	@telemachus	what do you mean you get no users?
2011-06-29 20:27:27	n1adir	none of my "real" users. not like system-stuff (games, statd, whatnot)
2011-06-29 20:27:36	n1adir	the ones with a "bash" at the end of the line
2011-06-29 20:28:00	@telemachus	hmm
2011-06-29 20:28:15	dbbolton	n1adir: i posted a comment with another way to do it
2011-06-29 20:28:20	n1adir	https://gist.github.com/1055353
2011-06-29 20:28:34	dbbolton	gives me the same output
2011-06-29 20:28:52	@telemachus	n1adir: Can you post a few of the lines that _don't_ show up?
2011-06-29 20:29:02	@telemachus	I want to see what's different about them
2011-06-29 20:29:27	n1adir	second, i am at it (both things)
2011-06-29 20:29:32	dbbolton	it's commas
2011-06-29 20:30:13	dbbolton	if ( /^(\w+):([\w:\/,]+)$/ ) {
2011-06-29 20:30:47	n1adir	i added a comment. there is one line, and yes, dbbolton is right, it contains commas.
2011-06-29 20:31:41	@telemachus	ok, I have a second question then: you want to get the usernames as the key
2011-06-29 20:31:46	@telemachus	what do you want as the value?
2011-06-29 20:33:00	n1adir	i only want a key. username seems to make sense.
2011-06-29 20:33:29	n1adir	the value is supposed to be all info of one line of /etc/passwd.
2011-06-29 20:33:41	@telemachus	all the info?
2011-06-29 20:33:41	n1adir	i went for an array, and as far i know a reference.
2011-06-29 20:33:47	n1adir	i have seen no easier way.
2011-06-29 20:33:51	@telemachus	hmm
2011-06-29 20:33:55	@telemachus	an array has no keys
2011-06-29 20:33:58	dbbolton	i was separating the username from the value to avoid redunancy 
2011-06-29 20:33:58	@telemachus	now I'm confused
2011-06-29 20:34:01	n1adir	but a hash has.
2011-06-29 20:34:04	@telemachus	let's start again
2011-06-29 20:34:08	@telemachus	you get these lines
2011-06-29 20:34:10	dbbolton	'associative array' 
2011-06-29 20:34:12	n1adir	the name is the key of the hash, the array is the value
2011-06-29 20:34:12	@telemachus	what do you want to do with them?
2011-06-29 20:34:30	@telemachus	ah, I see - ok
2011-06-29 20:34:31	n1adir	nothing. its just training different things.
2011-06-29 20:34:33	@telemachus	why an array?
2011-06-29 20:34:39	n1adir	no clue.
2011-06-29 20:34:44	@telemachus	sighs
2011-06-29 20:34:45	n1adir	i am not kidding.
2011-06-29 20:34:46	@telemachus	ok
2011-06-29 20:34:48	@telemachus	no joke
2011-06-29 20:34:51	n1adir	it came to my mind
2011-06-29 20:34:52	@telemachus	here's the thing
2011-06-29 20:34:55	@telemachus	_you_ have to know
2011-06-29 20:34:59	@telemachus	It's your program
2011-06-29 20:35:17	@telemachus	if you're programming without a good idea of what you're trying to do - even if it's for practice - it won't go well
2011-06-29 20:35:24	@telemachus	do this for me, please
2011-06-29 20:35:31	@telemachus	look at those lines in /etc/passwd
2011-06-29 20:35:35	n1adir	yes.
2011-06-29 20:35:37	@telemachus	then decide what you might want to do with them
2011-06-29 20:35:45	@telemachus	then we can make a script that does _that_
2011-06-29 20:36:53	n1adir	i hear you, but i think i lack ideas. It makes perferct sense. sure.
2011-06-29 20:37:07	n1adir	but i simply don't know. i am quite busy with the basics.
2011-06-29 20:37:21	@telemachus	I get that - it's tricky at first to know what you want to do.
2011-06-29 20:37:55	@telemachus	But seriously trying to do _something_ without knowing what that is - very likely to cause headache.
2011-06-29 20:38:26	n1adir	seen that way it worked rather well (but only this time, i really got that problem).
2011-06-29 20:38:31	dbbolton	n1adir: in case it helps, this is how i figured out the chars that the regex wasnt matching https://gist.github.com/1055330#gistcomment-38163
2011-06-29 20:39:23	dbbolton	(by 'deleting' everything i kn ew was matching)
2011-06-29 20:40:15	n1adir	i saved it all, and will work trough it.
2011-06-29 20:40:30	n1adir	in general the solution (by you) without regex is more easy for me.
2011-06-29 20:41:05	n1adir	so: what could one want to do with perl? i got no clue.
2011-06-29 20:42:07	dbbolton	i make it do my homework
2011-06-29 20:42:33	n1adir	homework?
2011-06-29 20:42:43	dbbolton	hausafgaben
2011-06-29 20:42:50	n1adir	for school?
2011-06-29 20:42:52	dbbolton	yeah
2011-06-29 20:42:55	dbbolton	auf*
2011-06-29 20:43:43	dbbolton	although i've been using octave more in recent months
2011-06-29 20:43:57	n1adir	to do homework?
2011-06-29 20:44:02	dbbolton	yeah
2011-06-29 20:44:04	n1adir	i am quite lost here.
2011-06-29 20:44:25	dbbolton	like a list of data that is used in a bunch of equations
2011-06-29 20:44:47	dbbolton	finding standard deviation, generating LaTeX tables, and so forth
2011-06-29 20:45:10	n1adir	ok, now i understand.
2011-06-29 20:45:18	n1adir	strange homework you got, btw.
2011-06-29 20:45:34	n1adir	We had to write never-ending rants about some wars, or so.
2011-06-29 20:45:55	dbbolton	i try to avoid writing as much as possible
2011-06-29 20:46:21	n1adir	apt-get install dadado
2011-06-29 20:46:31	n1adir	i missed a do: dadadodo
2011-06-29 20:47:02	n1adir	most of what i would need to do via scripting would be rsync-related. I think
2011-06-29 20:47:09	n1adir	perhaps examining log-files.
2011-06-29 20:47:13	n1adir	mhhh....
2011-06-29 20:47:20	n1adir	that idea does not sound bad.
2011-06-29 20:48:37	dbbolton	write a perl script that translates java into python
2011-06-29 20:48:44	@telemachus	n1adir: Maybe this? https://gist.github.com/1055386 (It does what I think you originally said - key of username, array ref of other fields for rest)
2011-06-29 20:49:53	n1adir	yes, i think like that.
2011-06-29 20:50:17	n1adir	my main question was if my code was too complicated.
2011-06-29 20:50:26	n1adir	yours looks more easy to understand.
2011-06-29 20:50:42	n1adir	more straight, or tight, so to speak.
2011-06-29 20:50:42	dbbolton	telemachus: uh-oh, I see a LOL
2011-06-29 20:50:59	@telemachus	dbbolton: What'd I do?
2011-06-29 20:51:12	dbbolton	i mean list-of-lists
2011-06-29 20:51:31	@telemachus	ah, whew
2011-06-29 20:51:42	@telemachus	I thought I did something laugh-out-loud stupid
2011-06-29 20:51:44	@telemachus	lol
2011-06-29 20:52:13	dbbolton	of course, nadir's original script was saving an array as a value
2011-06-29 20:52:18	@telemachus	n1adir: Ok, looking at your gist
2011-06-29 20:52:33	@telemachus	two things jump out at me
2011-06-29 20:52:45	@telemachus	1) you go through the whole set of lines twice - don't do that
2011-06-29 20:52:56	@telemachus	first in lines 10-13, then again in 22-26
2011-06-29 20:53:23	@telemachus	you should try to avoid that kind of double loop - unless it's absolutely necessary for some reason (here it's not)
2011-06-29 20:53:56	@telemachus	only other thing - more minor - is that line 25 worries me a little, maybe for no reason
2011-06-29 20:54:09	@telemachus	you use the first item in the array as the key but the whole array as the value
2011-06-29 20:54:26	@telemachus	somehow I want you to remove the name from the second value - not use it twice
2011-06-29 20:54:29	@telemachus	but that's probably silly
2011-06-29 20:54:44	@telemachus	so, really, the only issue is the double loop
2011-06-29 20:54:48	@telemachus	other than that, seems fine to me
2011-06-29 20:54:55	n1adir	yes, that is what i wanted ( as a key, but also as a value)
2011-06-29 20:55:07	n1adir	avoiding the dual-loop i hear for the first time.
2011-06-29 20:55:10	n1adir	will try that.
2011-06-29 20:55:24	@telemachus	do you see what I mean?
2011-06-29 20:55:26	n1adir	but it sure will make it harder.
2011-06-29 20:55:32	@telemachus	no, it shouldn't
2011-06-29 20:55:32	n1adir	the dual-loop?
2011-06-29 20:55:36	@telemachus	yup
2011-06-29 20:55:44	n1adir	yes, i see it. i simply did not know.
2011-06-29 20:55:50	@telemachus	dbbolton and I both do it in just one loop
2011-06-29 20:55:55	@telemachus	not harder - easier if anything
2011-06-29 20:56:04	@telemachus	take the code from your second loop and move it into the first loop
2011-06-29 20:56:09	@telemachus	done
2011-06-29 20:56:10	@telemachus	:)
2011-06-29 20:56:15	dbbolton	sort of like 'cat file | grep ...'
2011-06-29 20:56:47	n1adir	grep "duh" file
2011-06-29 20:56:54	n1adir	useless use of cat, no?
2011-06-29 20:56:55	@telemachus	yup
2011-06-29 20:57:06	dbbolton	yeah, reading the data twice
2011-06-29 20:57:08	n1adir	but that was silly, i got your point, dbbolton
2011-06-29 20:57:16	n1adir	ah, now i got it. duh.
2011-06-29 20:57:37	@telemachus	if the file had 10,000 lines, you would need 20,000 loops - half of which are not needed
2011-06-29 20:57:47	@telemachus	that's all - not the end of the world, but a good thing to look out for
2011-06-29 20:57:47	n1adir	that, avoiding dual-loop, will be quite a step. for me it _is_ harder.
2011-06-29 20:58:25	@telemachus	maybe for a time, sure
2011-06-29 20:58:31	dbbolton	do you ever try drawing a flow chart of your alogrithm before you start on your programs?
2011-06-29 20:58:39	n1adir	no.
2011-06-29 20:58:58	dbbolton	i do for bigger programs
2011-06-29 20:59:12	dbbolton	probably because i had to in CS
2011-06-29 20:59:38	@telemachus	I rarely do formal flow charts, but I do stuff like this a lot: ## Rationale

2011-06-29 21:00:15	@telemachus	I write a README and lay out what I want it to do - sort of a way of preparing to write the pieces
2011-06-29 21:01:23	dbbolton	as a right-brainer i like to see a map of the data flow before i start typing
2011-06-29 21:03:32	@telemachus	yup - I do it if the problem is really hairy/big/complex - otherwise, I usually cheat
2011-06-29 21:03:55	@telemachus	but I definitely agree that it's a good idea to write - literally write - something before you start coding
2011-06-29 21:04:18	@telemachus	I didn't always used to do it, but I try to now
2011-06-29 21:07:37	dbbolton	if there are more than 3 subroutines it's a must for more
2011-06-29 21:08:35	dbbolton	i need to get away from my computer before my eyes bleed

2011-07-02 09:17:05	n1adir	wait, i got a link i think
2011-07-02 09:18:33	dbbolton	like a blog
2011-07-02 09:18:52	n1adir	yes.
2011-07-02 09:19:12	n1adir	its said there are some in php and some in perl, but i can only find php ones.
2011-07-02 09:19:36	dbbolton	i think telemachus uses a program called jekyll written in ruby
2011-07-02 09:20:19	n1adir	i don't have problems with php (i think). I only think: i learn perl, hence it makes sense to use perl-tools.
2011-07-02 09:20:22	n1adir	Like that.
2011-07-02 09:20:38	n1adir	No idea if i really want to use such software (wordpress and such).
2011-07-02 09:20:47	n1adir	To me it looks very difficult, without gaining much.
2011-07-02 09:35:40	dbbolton	yeah, i don't get much from blogging
2011-07-02 09:36:05	n1adir	all i searched for was an easy way to add pictures on the fly.

2011-07-02 09:36:20	n1adir	I don't think its easy.

2011-07-02 09:44:55	n1adir	much better than man-soccer.
2011-07-02 09:47:28	n1adir	mhhh... i think i got Mars_Volta from one of your shots. If so: you know Diamanda Galas?
2011-07-02 09:51:30	dbbolton	no
2011-07-02 09:51:59	n1adir	you might like it. I got it on my web-site (which might fail), or search the forking web.

2011-07-06 14:01:17	@telemachus	I'm feeling a ton better all around. But there was a very ugly place in the middle.
2011-07-06 14:01:35	@telemachus	Not physical, weirdly, more mental. One day of physical ugh, then about four of mental abyss.
2011-07-06 14:01:43	nadir_	Sure.
2011-07-06 14:01:43	@telemachus	But now I'm feeling pretty good actually.
2011-07-06 14:01:47	@telemachus	How are you?
2011-07-06 14:01:48	nadir_	It _is_ a drug
2011-07-06 14:01:52	nadir_	i am so-so.
2011-07-06 14:02:00	nadir_	i am much in PC-stuff.
2011-07-06 14:02:01	@telemachus	Heh. Yes, I know. The wife reminds me daily.
2011-07-06 14:02:13	nadir_	sometimes i feel great, sometimes dumb like an idiot.
2011-07-06 14:02:23	nadir_	done a wee bit of html again.
2011-07-06 14:02:33	nadir_	that would suit me more, from the level, but is a bit boring too.
2011-07-06 14:03:29	@telemachus	Yes, HTML itself is kind of dry. But it builds up to cool stuff, sometimes.
2011-07-06 14:03:49	nadir_	i used <tables> to create thumbnails. That was a bit of fun.
2011-07-06 14:04:06	nadir_	thumbnails -> little pictures, not real thumbnails.
2011-07-06 14:04:24	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-06 14:04:25	@telemachus	I knew
2011-07-06 14:04:26	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-06 14:04:47	nadir_	yup. cool stuff. What sure is good is that you "see" a result immediatly. Much fun.
2011-07-06 14:05:12	nadir_	you ever heard of Apache::Gallery ?
2011-07-06 14:05:24	@telemachus	No, I don't know it.
2011-07-06 14:05:27	@telemachus	Photo thing?
2011-07-06 14:05:34	nadir_	(that is what i used, then i tried <tables> to emulate it.
2011-07-06 14:05:38	nadir_	yes.
2011-07-06 14:05:48	nadir_	dilberts-left_nut gave me the tip.
2011-07-06 14:05:58	nadir_	you install, configure, point it to a dir,
2011-07-06 14:06:09	nadir_	then: you copy and paste pics to the dir
2011-07-06 14:06:16	nadir_	and the web-site will show them.
2011-07-06 14:06:32	nadir_	no editing anymore, simply copy/paste
2011-07-06 14:06:35	@telemachus	nice
2011-07-06 14:06:38	@telemachus	gallery in a box
2011-07-06 14:06:41	nadir_	two problems:
2011-07-06 14:06:44	nadir_	a)Ram-hog
2011-07-06 14:06:53	nadir_	b) result looks a bit strange.  wait a sec.
2011-07-06 14:07:07	@telemachus	k
2011-07-06 14:07:13	nadir_	http://resident.dyndns.info/gallery/
2011-07-06 14:07:27	nadir_	i would prefer if it was more... mhh.... consistent.
2011-07-06 14:07:32	nadir_	all of the same size.
2011-07-06 14:08:23	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-06 14:08:33	@telemachus	That is you or Apache?
2011-07-06 14:08:59	nadir_	i don't understand. sorry.
2011-07-06 14:09:07	nadir_	i install libapache-galery-perl
2011-07-06 14:09:15	@telemachus	ah, right
2011-07-06 14:09:15	nadir_	then i configure apache to make use of it.
2011-07-06 14:09:22	nadir_	then it gets done automatic.
2011-07-06 14:09:29	@telemachus	but I meant the thing I'm looking at is it Apache or your version?
2011-07-06 14:09:33	nadir_	you can make heck lot of settings, but i don't understand all.
2011-07-06 14:09:35	@telemachus	I thought you redid it yourself with tables?
2011-07-06 14:09:41	nadir_	no.
2011-07-06 14:09:48	nadir_	that was just training.
2011-07-06 14:10:00	nadir_	i am not sure if i should not take my own version.
2011-07-06 14:10:14	nadir_	to add pictures i had to edit the file/html,
2011-07-06 14:10:21	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-06 14:10:23	nadir_	but it would be more to my liking (look and feel)
2011-07-06 14:10:32	@telemachus	Ok, well, with photos there are a handful of issues
2011-07-06 14:10:49	@telemachus	But the most important thing is that there is no real way to automatically make them exactly the same size
2011-07-06 14:10:56	@telemachus	Because the originals may be in different ratios
2011-07-06 14:11:23	@telemachus	example if one photo is 400 x 400, that's 1::1 but if another is 640 x 380...
2011-07-06 14:11:42	nadir_	yes. ok, i think i got that.
2011-07-06 14:11:50	@telemachus	so if the program _forces_ all to be say 400x250, then you will get fun-house mirror effect for some
2011-07-06 14:12:02	nadir_	exactly.
2011-07-06 14:12:20	nadir_	that what i did first. very strange result.
2011-07-06 14:13:18	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-06 14:13:25	@telemachus	you see it all over the web - common issue
2011-07-06 14:13:36	nadir_	wait a sec:
2011-07-06 14:13:40	@telemachus	(who is the tin-foil guy?)
2011-07-06 14:13:50	nadir_	so i can say: ok, leave it like that, its just a common issue.
2011-07-06 14:14:08	nadir_	the tin-foil-guy is from wikipedia. Its a hint that i am paranoid.
2011-07-06 14:14:11	nadir_	just a joke.
2011-07-06 14:14:27	nadir_	and i ain't got much pictures.
2011-07-06 14:14:58	nadir_	one easy: at the bottom there is the info about the perl-module.
2011-07-06 14:15:05	nadir_	You think i should leave it or not?
2011-07-06 14:15:19	nadir_	i don't care. If its usual to leave such info, i just leave them.
2011-07-06 14:15:56	nadir_	else i would remove it.
2011-07-06 14:17:10	nadir_	apache now uses 52MB of Ram (before something like 8). Not sure if pictures are that important to me.
2011-07-06 14:17:54	@telemachus	it's polite in a way
2011-07-06 14:18:04	nadir_	ok, thanks. thats what i assumed too.
2011-07-06 14:18:08	@telemachus	they make it freely, so they put something on the bottom and you leave it
2011-07-06 14:18:09	@telemachus	normal
2011-07-06 14:18:19	@telemachus	yeah, I would dump it honestly
2011-07-06 14:18:21	nadir_	ok, thanks. i assumed, but wanted to aks.
2011-07-06 14:18:31	@telemachus	make a picture gallery by hand for now
2011-07-06 14:18:43	@telemachus	not as pretty, but that much ram is nuts
2011-07-06 14:18:50	nadir_	yup.
2011-07-06 14:18:56	nadir_	i will play a bit more with it.
2011-07-06 14:19:05	nadir_	to let it sink. then go the manual way.
2011-07-06 14:19:15	nadir_	(like said: i ain't got much pictures anyway)
2011-07-06 14:20:01	@telemachus	fair enough
2011-07-06 14:20:02	nadir_	putting the pictures in a <table> looked quite nice to me, btw.
2011-07-06 14:20:17	nadir_	at least i could get them all to be the same size.
2011-07-06 14:20:19	@telemachus	most people recommend tables only for true tabular data
2011-07-06 14:20:21	@telemachus	not for layout
2011-07-06 14:20:27	nadir_	ah, i see.
2011-07-06 14:20:30	@telemachus	that's a no-no in modern web stuff
2011-07-06 14:20:31	@telemachus	but
2011-07-06 14:20:34	@telemachus	I won't tell if you do it
2011-07-06 14:20:35	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-06 14:20:47	nadir_	but it looks good, believe me.... :-)
2011-07-06 14:20:50	@telemachus	the prefered modern way is to use css for the layout
2011-07-06 14:20:52	@telemachus	yeah, I know
2011-07-06 14:21:00	@telemachus	tables are much easier to nice block layout
2011-07-06 14:21:42	nadir_	yes, you said so. And i stored it in my head, at a top-level-directory.
2011-07-06 14:21:52	nadir_	html -> css
2011-07-06 14:22:00	nadir_	css for layout.
2011-07-06 14:22:24	@telemachus	exactly
2011-07-06 14:22:37	@telemachus	html for content and structure of the content (meaning)
2011-07-06 14:22:47	@telemachus	and css for design, looks, presentation of the content (presentation)
2011-07-06 14:23:09	@telemachus	and javascript for anything interactive, changing, mutable (behavior)
2011-07-06 14:23:15	nadir_	wait.
2011-07-06 14:23:16	@telemachus	it's called the "separation of concerns"
2011-07-06 14:23:26	nadir_	you say javascript. What about php?
2011-07-06 14:23:34	nadir_	are they completely different?
2011-07-06 14:23:43	nadir_	(in "what" they do?)
2011-07-06 14:23:57	nadir_	if yes: fuck.
2011-07-06 14:24:04	@telemachus	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns#Examples
2011-07-06 14:24:07	@telemachus	for later
2011-07-06 14:24:15	@telemachus	yes and no
2011-07-06 14:24:21	@telemachus	about php vs. javascript
2011-07-06 14:24:22	nadir_	like in: do one thing, do it well :-)
2011-07-06 14:24:29	@telemachus	exactly!
2011-07-06 14:24:35	@telemachus	unix philosophy wins again
2011-07-06 14:24:37	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-06 14:24:56	nadir_	i like that. yes. i will do it (in the long run -> html -> css -> whatever)
2011-07-06 14:24:56	@telemachus	php and javascript are _both_ general purpose programming languages
2011-07-06 14:25:06	@telemachus	in that sense, they can do the same things
2011-07-06 14:25:11	@telemachus	but there's one huge difference
2011-07-06 14:25:22	@telemachus	php is server side - the code executes on the server
2011-07-06 14:25:41	@telemachus	javascript is client side (usually) - the code executes in the client - the browser
2011-07-06 14:25:57	@telemachus	so they are not really either/or
2011-07-06 14:26:06	nadir_	ok. But i could say: html->css->php too?
2011-07-06 14:26:16	@telemachus	a wordpress blog, for example, is built with php but also has javascript
2011-07-06 14:26:23	nadir_	cause whatever i read (atm), there seems no way around mysql and php.
2011-07-06 14:26:34	@telemachus	there are many ways around php
2011-07-06 14:26:35	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-06 14:26:39	@telemachus	python
2011-07-06 14:26:40	@telemachus	perl
2011-07-06 14:26:40	@telemachus	ruby
2011-07-06 14:26:44	nadir_	if i also have to add javascript i will shoot myself in the foot.
2011-07-06 14:26:47	@telemachus	here's what I mean
2011-07-06 14:26:53	@telemachus	(You do - I'm sorry.)
2011-07-06 14:26:57	 *	telemachus takes gun from nadir_ 
2011-07-06 14:27:02	nadir_	ha ha.
2011-07-06 14:27:13	@telemachus	Want more explanation or bored?
2011-07-06 14:27:36	nadir_	i am very excited (above i said i missed you a lot the last days...). Move on as long you like
2011-07-06 14:28:14	@telemachus	ok - well, you're safe from too long anyhow - I have a doctor's appointment at 3:15, so I leave at 3:00 (30 mins)
2011-07-06 14:28:17	@telemachus	hmm, ok
2011-07-06 14:28:29	@telemachus	lets start with the simplest site possible, k?
2011-07-06 14:28:40	nadir_	very ok.
2011-07-06 14:28:53	@telemachus	the site has just text. It says in a paragraph "hello world"
2011-07-06 14:29:00	@telemachus	that site needs _only_ HTML
2011-07-06 14:29:09	@telemachus	and a server - apache or whatever
2011-07-06 14:29:15	@telemachus	so far, so good?
2011-07-06 14:29:20	nadir_	yes, sure.
2011-07-06 14:29:24	@telemachus	awesome
2011-07-06 14:29:30	nadir_	me is GOD.
2011-07-06 14:29:33	@telemachus	now, imagine you want to make it pretty
2011-07-06 14:29:34	@telemachus	laughs
2011-07-06 14:29:49	@telemachus	you want a purple background with the cutesy-wootsy spaceship from debian
2011-07-06 14:30:03	@telemachus	so you get the image, pick your fonts, pick colors...
2011-07-06 14:30:09	@telemachus	all that goes into css
2011-07-06 14:30:15	nadir_	good too.
2011-07-06 14:30:25	@telemachus	so now we have hello world in html and design in css
2011-07-06 14:30:28	@telemachus	so far so good?
2011-07-06 14:30:32	nadir_	yes.
2011-07-06 14:30:43	@telemachus	ok, now we get more fun
2011-07-06 14:30:44	nadir_	not that i could do it on the fly, but i got the concept.
2011-07-06 14:31:28	@telemachus	we want the site to have a popup - when you appear there, a popup should appear in your browser, ask for your name, and then insert the name into the page's content
2011-07-06 14:31:40	@telemachus	So no more "hello world", but now "hello $whoever"
2011-07-06 14:31:44	@telemachus	also good?
2011-07-06 14:31:59	@telemachus	good as in, you know what I mean, not how
2011-07-06 14:32:06	nadir_	i think so.
2011-07-06 14:32:19	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-06 14:32:26	@telemachus	that goes into javascript
2011-07-06 14:32:26	nadir_	yes, now i got it. ok
2011-07-06 14:32:33	@telemachus	not php, not perl, not ruby, not python
2011-07-06 14:32:34	nadir_	wait.
2011-07-06 14:32:36	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-06 14:32:39	nadir_	why not those?
2011-07-06 14:32:43	@telemachus	good, right
2011-07-06 14:33:00	@telemachus	not those because those happen on the machine where the server + html files live
2011-07-06 14:33:06	@telemachus	they happen _over there_
2011-07-06 14:33:15	@telemachus	but I want the change to be triggered over here
2011-07-06 14:33:24	nadir_	uhum.
2011-07-06 14:33:27	@telemachus	when the user visits the page - in this browser, and that one, and that one
2011-07-06 14:33:41	@telemachus	think of it like this: there's only one server - but potentially 100s of clients
2011-07-06 14:33:46	@telemachus	all at the site at the same time
2011-07-06 14:33:49	nadir_	server -> shake and tremble
2011-07-06 14:33:56	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-06 14:34:51	@telemachus	the thing is that some triggers can't be tracked on the server side
2011-07-06 14:34:57	@telemachus	they must be tracked on the client side
2011-07-06 14:35:00	@telemachus	another example, ok?
2011-07-06 14:35:05	nadir_	yes, ok
2011-07-06 14:35:44	@telemachus	on some websites, when you move your mouse over certain parts of the site, you get biggish information boxes, sort of like tool tips
2011-07-06 14:35:48	@telemachus	does that sound familiar?
2011-07-06 14:35:57	nadir_	yes.
2011-07-06 14:35:59	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-06 14:36:14	@telemachus	think of it this way - the server is with you in germany
2011-07-06 14:36:27	@telemachus	you, me and dbbolton are all visiting the same site at the same time, k?
2011-07-06 14:36:32	nadir_	yeah
2011-07-06 14:36:56	@telemachus	I move my mouse to item 3, you move yours to item 10 and dbbolton has no mouse on the page at all. He's just reading.
2011-07-06 14:37:01	@telemachus	So far, so good?
2011-07-06 14:37:06	nadir_	yes.
2011-07-06 14:37:21	@telemachus	There is literally _no way_ for the server to know where our mice are.
2011-07-06 14:37:31	nadir_	ah.
2011-07-06 14:37:32	@telemachus	So php, python, perl, ruby are useless in this case.
2011-07-06 14:37:54	@telemachus	However, there is one thing that knows where my mouse is at any time - my own desktop and its applications
2011-07-06 14:37:57	@telemachus	Like the browser
2011-07-06 14:38:07	@telemachus	the browser knows where the mouse is
2011-07-06 14:38:14	@telemachus	and javascript is built into the browser
2011-07-06 14:38:41	@telemachus	want a weird, fun little example (real code)?
2011-07-06 14:38:51	nadir_	have at it.
2011-07-06 14:39:31	@telemachus	k, one sec
2011-07-06 14:41:52	@telemachus	Ok, now, do me a favor - at first, don't even try to read all these files. You'll flip. :)
2011-07-06 14:41:55	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/1068003
2011-07-06 14:42:17	@telemachus	download all three and put them in one place (same directory, anywhere)
2011-07-06 14:42:34	@telemachus	make sure the names are right "index.html", "2.js" and "backbone-min.js"
2011-07-06 14:42:41	@telemachus	tell me when you're good
2011-07-06 14:44:08	nadir_	are there, and names are right.
2011-07-06 14:44:46	@telemachus	ok, open index.html in a browser
2011-07-06 14:44:55	nadir_	did it.
2011-07-06 14:44:55	@telemachus	probably you can just double click it
2011-07-06 14:44:57	nadir_	cool stuff.
2011-07-06 14:45:03	nadir_	add/remove
2011-07-06 14:45:09	@telemachus	ok, so you see "add/remove"
2011-07-06 14:45:10	nadir_	ha. very funny. really.
2011-07-06 14:45:11	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-07-06 14:45:13	@telemachus	now
2011-07-06 14:45:14	@telemachus	wait
2011-07-06 14:45:18	@telemachus	here's the _real_ magic
2011-07-06 14:45:25	@telemachus	in the browser go to "View source"
2011-07-06 14:45:32	nadir_	ok
2011-07-06 14:45:49	@telemachus	not 100% sure where it is, but probably easy to find
2011-07-06 14:45:52	@telemachus	?
2011-07-06 14:45:59	nadir_	yes, i got it.
2011-07-06 14:46:03	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-06 14:46:08	@telemachus	look at the html for a sec
2011-07-06 14:46:12	@telemachus	then add a few items
2011-07-06 14:46:16	@telemachus	then look at the html again
2011-07-06 14:46:22	@telemachus	what do you notice?
2011-07-06 14:46:32	nadir_	ow you lost me.
2011-07-06 14:46:38	nadir_	add items where?
2011-07-06 14:46:48	nadir_	the source only contains -> source la la.
2011-07-06 14:47:11	nadir_	damn -> <script src="la-la">
2011-07-06 14:47:16	@telemachus	right
2011-07-06 14:47:23	@telemachus	THE ITEMS ARE NOT IN THE HTML
2011-07-06 14:47:35	nadir_	oh.
2011-07-06 14:47:36	@telemachus	they are added, dynamically, by the javascript
2011-07-06 14:47:41	@telemachus	it's all magic
2011-07-06 14:47:43	@telemachus	!!!
2011-07-06 14:48:02	@telemachus	javascript basically tricks your browser into thinking it's there
2011-07-06 14:48:05	@telemachus	but it ain't
2011-07-06 14:48:41	@telemachus	but again, what's maybe most important is that javascript allows you to have items 1, 2, 3
2011-07-06 14:48:45	@telemachus	me to have 1 only
2011-07-06 14:48:51	@telemachus	dbbolton to have 1,2,3,4
2011-07-06 14:49:00	@telemachus	because they're not all stored on the server
2011-07-06 14:49:06	@telemachus	they're different in each client
2011-07-06 14:49:09	@telemachus	does that make sense?
2011-07-06 14:50:31	nadir_	ah, yes.
2011-07-06 14:50:53	nadir_	very good example.
2011-07-06 14:51:01	nadir_	i am getting closer. much closer.
2011-07-06 14:51:16	@telemachus	good
2011-07-06 14:51:25	@telemachus	php + mysql is very powerful and useful
2011-07-06 14:51:42	@telemachus	but really what it means is this: server-side programming language + database
2011-07-06 14:51:49	@telemachus	so the language does NOT have to be php
2011-07-06 14:51:58	@telemachus	and the database does NOT have to be mysql
2011-07-06 14:52:05	@telemachus	there are many choices for both
2011-07-06 14:52:05	nadir_	sec.
2011-07-06 14:52:08	@telemachus	k
2011-07-06 14:52:16	nadir_	most of the tools you will find will use those two.
2011-07-06 14:52:27	nadir_	i run across the php-mysql duo all the time.
2011-07-06 14:52:38	@telemachus	yes and no
2011-07-06 14:52:42	@telemachus	yes, there are a ton of those
2011-07-06 14:52:47	nadir_	it might be ~possible~, but what i read ...
2011-07-06 14:52:50	@telemachus	but things are changing
2011-07-06 14:52:52	nadir_	yes, might be.
2011-07-06 14:52:54	@telemachus	more and more use other things
2011-07-06 14:53:02	nadir_	i usually check the German ubuntu wiki.
2011-07-06 14:53:04	@telemachus	many, many no longer use php
2011-07-06 14:53:10	@telemachus	and mysql is fading fast
2011-07-06 14:53:12	nadir_	_there most is php/mysql
2011-07-06 14:53:31	@telemachus	postgresql is coming up fast, also many other types of database - too many to list even
2011-07-06 14:53:40	@telemachus	google for nosql
2011-07-06 14:54:05	nadir_	yes, i read about it at debian-planet ("all the cool kids now use nosql" :-) )
2011-07-06 14:54:20	nadir_	i did not understand, but as i don't know about sql its no miracle.
2011-07-06 14:54:37	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-06 14:54:38	@telemachus	fair enough
2011-07-06 14:54:45	@telemachus	ok, shit - I must clean up and go get a bus
2011-07-06 14:54:47	@telemachus	sorry
2011-07-06 14:54:53	@telemachus	we will talk more soon, yeah?
2011-07-06 14:55:38	nadir_	ah, thanks a ton.
2011-07-06 14:55:49	nadir_	good luck (or whatever one says)
2011-07-06 14:56:10	nadir_	we will talk -> my main interest sure is how perl goes into that...
2011-07-06 14:56:43	nadir_	let me stress it: thanks. really. i know way more than a few minutes ago.
2011-07-06 14:57:45	@telemachus	cool, I'm glad
2011-07-06 14:57:48	@telemachus	good to see you again

2011-07-09 18:23:27	nadir	looks perfect for a dude like me (yellow)
2011-07-09 18:23:40	nadir	anyway:  i already removed Apache::Galery
2011-07-09 18:23:45	nadir	too much fiddling.
2011-07-09 18:23:52	nadir	you think my general idea is ok?
2011-07-09 18:23:58	nadir	for a few pictures only.
2011-07-09 18:24:14	nadir	i don't plan to post albums, only  a picture now and then.
2011-07-09 18:25:35	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/1074006
2011-07-09 18:25:59	@telemachus	One other thing, for <img>, you should _always_ have an alt attribute
2011-07-09 18:26:12	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-09 18:26:16	nadir	like in your gist?
2011-07-09 18:26:26	@telemachus	Yup
2011-07-09 18:26:30	nadir	i remove the closing </img> and add the alt-"tag"
2011-07-09 18:26:38	@telemachus	that's why I posted
2011-07-09 18:26:39	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-09 18:26:45	nadir	and besides that: should be a solution ok.
2011-07-09 18:26:46	nadir	good.
2011-07-09 18:26:51	nadir	i prefer that method.
2011-07-09 18:26:53	@telemachus	the alt should be a short description
2011-07-09 18:26:57	@telemachus	and yeah, it looks good
2011-07-09 18:27:00	nadir	less trouble, looks better, less resources...
2011-07-09 18:27:09	@telemachus	awesome
2011-07-09 18:27:39	nadir	let me save your gist, so i can have a look later. second
2011-07-09 18:28:23	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-09 18:28:29	@telemachus	actually I have to pop off too
2011-07-09 18:28:40	@telemachus	I only came on because I saw you just posted the gist - figured you were in here
2011-07-09 18:28:45	nadir	cool bean. i will try to set it up. thanks for the help
2011-07-09 18:28:49	@telemachus	np
2011-07-09 18:28:56	@telemachus	have a good one
2011-07-09 18:29:41	↔	telemachus is now known as zz_telemachus
2011-07-09 19:29:18	dbbolton	actually i'm an XML-foo master 
2011-07-09 19:29:49	nadir	ah, well. xm-what?
2011-07-09 19:29:50	dbbolton	IT'S <img /> OR IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG!!!
2011-07-09 19:29:58	nadir	:-)
2011-07-09 19:30:52	dbbolton	i believe html 4.0 transitional allows you to omit the / on self-closing tags like <br />
2011-07-09 19:31:03	nadir	i would not know.
2011-07-09 19:31:15	dbbolton	i prefer xhtml strict
2011-07-09 19:32:04	nadir	you need to speak easy to me. For me its all a bunch of voodoo.
2011-07-09 19:32:31	nadir	i started as i wanted to put my writings online, and i started with OOffice
2011-07-09 19:32:32	dbbolton	different doctypes
2011-07-09 19:32:45	nadir	tele gave me the business, and so i rewrote it in html
2011-07-09 19:32:50	nadir	its rather easy.
2011-07-09 19:33:07	nadir	different: the most easy way possible.
2011-07-09 19:33:16	nadir	but i got a different question, if you got a minute.
2011-07-09 19:33:29	nadir	i have seen you got a web-site, you posted the link at github.
2011-07-09 19:33:32	nadir	now my question:
2011-07-09 19:33:44	dbbolton	shoot
2011-07-09 19:33:51	nadir	say i give the adress, how serious is the danger to be attacked?
2011-07-09 19:34:03	nadir	i would not know how it was possible at all...
2011-07-09 19:34:22	dbbolton	well
2011-07-09 19:35:25	dbbolton	in order to access the non-public files on my server, someone would need access to either my username and password or my ssh key
2011-07-09 19:36:04	nadir	same here.
2011-07-09 19:36:05	dbbolton	it's a lenny machine
2011-07-09 19:37:08	nadir	so you would say it is rather safe to tell someone the apache-address?
2011-07-09 19:37:21	nadir	as far i can see: it should, but i can't see very far.
2011-07-09 19:37:28	dbbolton	you mean the IP of the server?
2011-07-09 19:38:10	nadir	ip or address is the same, in case i give it away, or not?
2011-07-09 19:38:26	nadir	if i tell someone "go to foo.master.net" he also knows the ip
2011-07-09 19:38:38	nadir	or am i more un-foo than usual?
2011-07-09 19:38:56	dbbolton	well it depends on whether the ip is static or not
2011-07-09 19:39:07	nadir	ah, no, i am not static.
2011-07-09 19:40:02	dbbolton	i guess at a given moment they're the same
2011-07-09 19:40:09	nadir	but anyway: You don't say: "are you insane"?
2011-07-09 19:40:34	dbbolton	well, i don't really trust anyone, personally. but i'm marginally paranoid
2011-07-09 19:40:38	nadir	i barely know or care about security, but a web-site which i don't tell to others seems strange.
2011-07-09 19:40:57	nadir	besides the learning-purpose, which sure is fun.
2011-07-09 19:41:18	nadir	paranoid or not: i can'T see how one would want to crack a web-site.
2011-07-09 19:41:37	dbbolton	oh, by address you mean your domain name?
2011-07-09 19:41:45	nadir	yes.
2011-07-09 19:41:47	dbbolton	not the address of the server
2011-07-09 19:42:05	nadir	mhh...now you confuse me. sorry.
2011-07-09 19:42:11	dbbolton	well there's not much point in hosting a site if no one else knows about it
2011-07-09 19:42:17	nadir	i got the server running here.
2011-07-09 19:42:26	nadir	i get a dynamic ip by my ISP.
2011-07-09 19:42:46	nadir	i use dyndns to have got access without the changing IP.
2011-07-09 19:42:56	nadir	(which doesn't always work)
2011-07-09 19:43:09	dbbolton	but you're probably behind a router and or firewall ( i hope )
2011-07-09 19:43:16	nadir	yes, router.
2011-07-09 19:43:45	nadir	two ports are open: http, ssh and ... mhh... torrent too (thats the magic 3)
2011-07-09 19:43:58	dbbolton	so there's no way for me to read any files on your local server unless you configure the router for remote access which is not a good idea generally
2011-07-09 19:44:01	nadir	ssh is with keys
2011-07-09 19:44:32	nadir	so, to sum it up:
2011-07-09 19:44:43	nadir	besides the usual paranoia which is always a good thing,
2011-07-09 19:44:44	dbbolton	i have a domain dbbolton.us but the files are on a server provided by dreamhost.com
2011-07-09 19:44:51	nadir	its not completely insane?
2011-07-09 19:45:15	dbbolton	i would say don't allow remote acces to your personal computer
2011-07-09 19:45:41	nadir	and with remote access you mean?
2011-07-09 19:45:43	nadir	ssh?
2011-07-09 19:46:18	dbbolton	ssh is designed for remote administration and to a lesser extent file transfer, not http
2011-07-09 19:46:48	nadir	i don'T think i understand you.
2011-07-09 19:46:56	nadir	one can access http remotely?
2011-07-09 19:47:01	dbbolton	you mean from the hosting company?
2011-07-09 19:47:20	nadir	no, you said something about remote access.
2011-07-09 19:47:23	nadir	then i said: ssh?
2011-07-09 19:47:28	nadir	then you said: http.
2011-07-09 19:47:34	dbbolton	like i can ssh to my host's servers where my website's files are
2011-07-09 19:47:45	nadir	sure i can do that.
2011-07-09 19:47:58	dbbolton	well, normally you only use ssh on your local network
2011-07-09 19:48:05	nadir	huh?
2011-07-09 19:48:07	dbbolton	behind your router
2011-07-09 19:48:19	nadir	i don't think so.
2011-07-09 19:48:23	nadir	but.. well....
2011-07-09 19:48:49	dbbolton	and maybe occasionally on github or something
2011-07-09 19:48:53	dbbolton	right?
2011-07-09 19:49:39	nadir	ah, me. Yes, i usually use it here, on the local network (+from other places if i want to reach home, +github and similar things)
2011-07-09 19:49:47	nadir	but usually here, locally, behind the router.
2011-07-09 19:50:44	dbbolton	and you want to let people use ssh to see your website on your home computer? is that it
2011-07-09 19:50:54	nadir	no.
2011-07-09 19:51:10	dbbolton	so what do you want to do
2011-07-09 19:51:12	nadir	i want people to use a web-browser, type in the address and look at the web-site.
2011-07-09 19:51:21	nadir	isn't that the usual way?
2011-07-09 19:51:39	nadir	no ssh.
2011-07-09 19:51:59	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info -> in browser
2011-07-09 19:52:01	dbbolton	what address
2011-07-09 19:52:15	dbbolton	exactly
2011-07-09 19:52:23	dbbolton	the one your IP gives you?
2011-07-09 19:52:31	nadir	yes
2011-07-09 19:52:57	dbbolton	that IP is to your router
2011-07-09 19:53:03	nadir	yes
2011-07-09 19:53:42	dbbolton	and your router is not a web server
2011-07-09 19:54:02	dbbolton	or at least not the server with your site
2011-07-09 19:54:11	nadir	the router is just a router. The web-server is on a PC here.
2011-07-09 19:54:17	dbbolton	right
2011-07-09 19:54:42	nadir	the router is set to forward 80
2011-07-09 19:54:57	dbbolton	is that a port?
2011-07-09 19:55:08	nadir	sure, port 80.
2011-07-09 19:55:12	nadir	for http.
2011-07-09 19:55:44	dbbolton	and it forwards to your apache server
2011-07-09 19:55:50	nadir	yes.
2011-07-09 19:56:29	dbbolton	personally i probably wouldnt do that
2011-07-09 19:56:45	nadir	puh. So: why?
2011-07-09 19:56:53	nadir	how on earth could one crack that?
2011-07-09 19:57:07	nadir	i searched youtube for how to crack apache, but can't find anything.
2011-07-09 19:57:18	dbbolton	you make one tiny chmod error and you're fucked
2011-07-09 19:57:22	nadir	crack in the meaning of: get access.
2011-07-09 19:57:42	nadir	can you explain how that should get me into trouble?
2011-07-09 19:57:47	dbbolton	or one config error with apache
2011-07-09 19:57:48	nadir	i really can't imagine it
2011-07-09 19:59:10	dbbolton	let's say you accidentally give read access to a private file
2011-07-09 20:00:20	dbbolton	or execute access to a script that you own that reads or writes outside your www dir
2011-07-09 20:00:42	dbbolton	sure, you could be careful, but there is still a possibility
2011-07-09 20:00:55	nadir	but they would need to be at /var/www or not?
2011-07-09 20:01:26	dbbolton	whatever apache is set to share
2011-07-09 20:02:36	dbbolton	you could give me the address to find out what mischief i might cause if you really think it's safe
2011-07-09 20:02:47	dbbolton	;)
2011-07-09 20:03:01	nadir	i already gave it above
2011-07-09 20:03:08	nadir	but right now its not reachable
2011-07-09 20:03:25	nadir	dyndsn doesn't get the updated ip, for what reason ever.
2011-07-09 20:03:32	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-09 20:04:24	nadir	well: you might try the IP: 92.224.242.215
2011-07-09 20:04:55	dbbolton	the name doesn't respond to ping
2011-07-09 20:05:02	nadir	yes.
2011-07-09 20:05:21	nadir	the problem is that the IP is new, and for unknown reason it doesn't get send to dyndns.
2011-07-09 20:05:40	nadir	i could shutdown. shutdown router. start router. reboot.
2011-07-09 20:05:43	nadir	or i can wait.
2011-07-09 20:05:46	dbbolton	also no whois info
2011-07-09 20:05:48	nadir	i decided to wait.
2011-07-09 20:05:53	nadir	it can't.
2011-07-09 20:06:00	nadir	dyndns hasn't got the new IP
2011-07-09 20:06:54	dbbolton	and these files are all on your home pc?
2011-07-09 20:12:28	nadir	i got a PC and kind of a server
2011-07-09 20:12:42	nadir	what do you mean with "these" files?
2011-07-09 20:12:50	nadir	the web-site? yes, they are on the server.
2011-07-09 20:14:25	dbbolton	yeah, but i mean is the server your home pc
2011-07-09 20:14:42	nadir	the one i use for my daily ride? no.
2011-07-09 20:15:00	nadir	but i backup most of my data there.
2011-07-09 20:15:08	nadir	besides that it hosts the Web-site
2011-07-09 20:17:43	dbbolton	to answer your original question
2011-07-09 20:18:01	dbbolton	i would say, yeah, it's "pretty" safe
2011-07-09 20:18:33	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-09 20:18:47	nadir	i think so too, besides the usual un-safety.
2011-07-09 20:20:01	nadir	so i will add some porn and let the world have at it.... :-)
2011-07-09 20:21:19	nadir	and thanks.
2011-07-09 20:22:25	dbbolton	just don't set up ftp or anything
2011-07-09 20:22:38	nadir	yup
2011-07-09 20:22:53	nadir	i plaid a bit with it in Vbox, but not much (with ftp)
2011-07-09 20:23:35	dbbolton	normally when you go to a website, you can't see what all is in the top directory
2011-07-09 20:24:09	nadir	but you can see it here? i guess no... but better ask.
2011-07-09 20:24:15	dbbolton	no
2011-07-09 20:24:26	nadir	good.
2011-07-09 20:24:37	dbbolton	however, i can access the other directories
2011-07-09 20:24:44	nadir	and the site is static, so i hpe that helps
2011-07-09 20:25:26	dbbolton	for example http://92.224.242.215/content
2011-07-09 20:25:47	dbbolton	i can see all the files there
2011-07-09 20:26:02	nadir	yeah, but thats what they are there for. They are for the public
2011-07-09 20:26:11	nadir	if i am not confused.
2011-07-09 20:26:30	dbbolton	just make sure you don't put something that you don't want people to see in there
2011-07-09 20:26:38	dbbolton	like cgi scripts or something
2011-07-09 20:26:45	nadir	ah, yes. got you.
2011-07-09 20:26:54	nadir	like said: in general its a rather easy side.
2011-07-09 20:27:01	nadir	just html/bit-of-css
2011-07-09 20:27:05	nadir	not other language
2011-07-09 20:28:08	nadir	like php, perl, python, whatever
2011-07-09 20:28:16	nadir	the cgi-stuff.
2011-07-09 20:29:16	nadir	.
2011-07-09 20:29:31	nadir	today i made a google-web-site for some people who start a project.
2011-07-09 20:29:38	nadir	that was a big pain.Very slow.
2011-07-09 20:29:52	nadir	i will try to convince them to use riseup.net
2011-07-09 20:30:06	nadir	all they want is present themselves to the public.
2011-07-09 20:30:28	nadir	sounds cool to add: go here http://la-la-nut-and-crazy.com
2011-07-09 20:30:37	nadir	so i guess they will be happy.
2011-07-09 20:31:17	nadir	will show it to them, if they say: "ok" i got to insert the info.
2011-07-09 20:35:07	nadir	but i got to have breakfast now, as its 3:00 in the night.
2011-07-09 20:35:16	nadir	later. and thanks again.

2011-07-13 12:06:45	dbb0	(
2011-07-13 12:07:06	nadir	hi, dbb0, aka aka.
2011-07-13 12:07:42	dbb0	hey
2011-07-13 12:07:59	nadir	can i ask you a perl question?
2011-07-13 12:08:08	dbb0	shoot
2011-07-13 12:08:26	nadir	i am trying to get something running. To keep it short:
2011-07-13 12:08:43	nadir	i want to replace some html-lines like this:
2011-07-13 12:08:49	nadir	<!-- placholder-->
2011-07-13 12:08:53	nadir	with something like:
2011-07-13 12:09:17	nadir	<a href="la-la-la/path">name_of</a>
2011-07-13 12:09:23	nadir	to give the idea, i am tired.
2011-07-13 12:09:26	nadir	could i do that with
2011-07-13 12:09:44	nadir	s/<!-- placeholder-->/all_the_new/
2011-07-13 12:10:00	nadir	or would another tool be better than s/first/second/
2011-07-13 12:10:12	nadir	not sure if it was clear, i hope yes.
2011-07-13 12:10:31	dbb0	probably all at once.
2011-07-13 12:10:49	nadir	ah, wait, i would also need to append the line <!-- placholder --> again.
2011-07-13 12:10:57	dbb0	the larger/more specific your pattern is, the less likely you'll end up wuth an accidental match
2011-07-13 12:11:12	dbb0	well, hold on a sec
2011-07-13 12:11:15	nadir	k
2011-07-13 12:18:41	dbb0	here's an example
2011-07-13 12:19:11	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1080666
2011-07-13 12:20:32	nadir	thank you sir. I will download it and use it as a template.
2011-07-13 12:20:45	nadir	(assuming i will find it again, its such a mess here....)
2011-07-13 12:23:05	nadir	i saved it in several places, so i got a bit of hope.
2011-07-13 12:23:39	dbb0	if you need more sophisticated substitutions you should look into named backrefs
2011-07-13 12:23:58	nadir	uhum. not sure.
2011-07-13 12:24:09	nadir	if yes i will try or ask again.
2011-07-13 12:24:16	dbb0	https://github.com/dbbolton/perl-stuff/blob/master/basic-re-cheat.pl
2011-07-13 12:24:27	nadir	ah, yes, i got that one in mind.
2011-07-13 12:24:34	nadir	good that you say its there.
2011-07-13 12:28:31	dbb0	are you trying to make some sort of html templates for your site?
2011-07-13 12:28:43	nadir	it is the plan.
2011-07-13 12:29:06	nadir	what i want is an automatic way to add pictures and thumbnails which i want to search for in a certain directory.
2011-07-13 12:29:20	nadir	if those are not found in the html-file, add them with said method.
2011-07-13 12:29:28	nadir	something like that.
2011-07-13 12:29:29	dbb0	you might save some time using markdown
2011-07-13 12:29:45	nadir	uff. To be honest: i am not sure what it is at all.
2011-07-13 12:30:10	dbb0	http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics
2011-07-13 12:30:36	dbb0	debian: libtext-markdown-perl
2011-07-13 12:31:01	nadir	ah, ok. let me write that down.
2011-07-13 12:32:03	nadir	the s/pattern/replace trick is quite "strange". It never really does what i expect it too.
2011-07-13 12:32:16	nadir	i guess it will help me to do some learning.
2011-07-13 12:32:28	nadir	it -> the little project.
2011-07-13 12:40:40	dbb0	do you use a lot of * in your patterns
2011-07-13 12:41:15	nadir	mhh... if you mean those two from above: no, they are rather "static"
2011-07-13 12:41:29	nadir	else: not sure. I don't use regex very often.
2011-07-13 12:41:35	nadir	i am really at the very beginning.
2011-07-13 12:42:32	dbb0	so that's probably why s// doesn't work as you expect
2011-07-13 12:42:53	nadir	ah, no.
2011-07-13 12:43:13	nadir	it often gives me the amount of changes done, but doesn't really change.
2011-07-13 12:43:22	nadir	my fault, i know.
2011-07-13 12:43:47	nadir	it is not really clear to me when happens what. I have to try a few times.
2011-07-13 12:45:21	nadir	.
2011-07-13 12:45:37	nadir	the other thing i never really understand is when to use "foreach" and when "while"
2011-07-13 12:46:01	dbb0	"for" is to iterate over a list
2011-07-13 12:46:26	dbb0	"while" is to do something as long as a condition is true
2011-07-13 12:46:51	dbb0	i guess 'while (<$in>)' is kind of an exception
2011-07-13 12:47:05	dbb0	but the diamond operator <> is special
2011-07-13 12:47:07	nadir	mhhh... ah, just wanted to say something like that.
2011-07-13 12:47:10	nadir	ok, got it.
2011-07-13 12:47:52	nadir	foreach my $line (<$filehandle>) would work too, or not?
2011-07-13 12:48:34	dbb0	no, i don't think so
2011-07-13 12:48:45	nadir	damn.
2011-07-13 12:48:46	dbb0	because <$fh> isn't an array
2011-07-13 12:48:57	dbb0	http://perldoc.perl.org/perlintro.html#Files-and-I/O
2011-07-13 12:51:01	dbb0	actually it does work
2011-07-13 12:51:40	nadir	yes. just tested, but it would not be "right", i guess.
2011-07-13 12:51:49	nadir	what confused me was that it did work.
2011-07-13 12:52:06	nadir	then i could not figure out when "foreach" and when "while"
2011-07-13 12:52:07	dbb0	it's context-dependent
2011-07-13 12:52:29	dbb0	when you ask for an array (like the for loop), you get one
2011-07-13 12:52:41	dbb0	each line is an element of the array
2011-07-13 12:52:59	dbb0	including the trailing \n
2011-07-13 12:53:31	dbb0	while (<$in>) is doing pretty much the same thing- giving you one line at a time
2011-07-13 12:53:44	dbb0	but it's not being stored as an array
2011-07-13 12:54:03	dbb0	you can store it though, but you probably don't need to in most cases.
2011-07-13 12:54:26	nadir	i think i got you. I guess its clear with what kind of problems i fight with (rather basic ones).
2011-07-13 12:57:38	dbb0	if you're reading from a file, the information is already stored so it doesn't make sense to store it in the script (generally)
2011-07-13 13:04:59	dbb0	actually it would be stored in memory
2011-07-13 13:09:24	dbb0	ah
2011-07-13 13:09:31	dbb0	"The <FH> construct is not the name of the filehandle, it is a readline operation on that handle. The data read is assigned to $_ only if the file read is the sole condition in a while loop"
2011-07-13 13:21:32	nadir	see us later. thanks for the help.

2011-07-14 13:17:31	nadir	i am just moving all the /var/www and ~/public_html around to my PC
2011-07-14 13:17:44	nadir	so i can start with trying to get the perl code running.
2011-07-14 13:18:07	nadir	bit confusing. rsync doesn't always what i do, and linking with ln is not my thing neither.
2011-07-14 13:18:12	nadir	looks like i am done yet.
2011-07-14 13:18:58	dbb0	what rsync options are you using
2011-07-14 13:19:28	nadir	either -ruy or -auv, seldom something different.
2011-07-14 13:20:25	nadir	but the problem is: i always mix /path/to/ with /path/to
2011-07-14 13:20:43	nadir	so i need to move it again, once it is rsynced...
2011-07-14 13:21:42	nadir	well: and a day later i forgot where i saved it, and run it again.
2011-07-14 13:23:19	nadir	the very short version is that i am not used to run several machines and keep them in sync.
2011-07-14 13:26:08	nadir	ah, btw, what about your web-site? is it making progress?

2011-07-14 13:59:40	dbb0	imgur.com

2011-07-14 14:03:02	dbb0	cool. thanks
2011-07-14 14:03:15	nadir	both links give me an Oops, but look pretty much the same
2011-07-14 14:03:16	nadir	np
2011-07-14 14:03:28	dbb0	yeah, i haven't made the pages yet
2011-07-14 14:03:52	nadir	i thought so, but won't hurt to tell it (i thought)
2011-07-14 14:04:01	nadir	anyway: i like style of that kind.
2011-07-14 14:04:30	dbb0	it's because i don't know enough CSS to make it fancy ;)
2011-07-14 14:05:10	nadir	what i for one would like (for me), is something like a frame.
2011-07-14 14:05:20	nadir	that is the background similar to what you got (and me too),
2011-07-14 14:05:27	nadir	but a little frame around it.
2011-07-14 14:05:34	nadir	mhh... i can't describe it good.
2011-07-14 14:05:45	nadir	bit of a contrast to all in one colour.
2011-07-14 14:05:47	dbb0	border
2011-07-14 14:05:57	nadir	well: yeah. like that.
2011-07-14 14:06:35	nadir	but besides that i like that look and feel.
2011-07-14 14:10:15	dbb0	something like that
2011-07-14 14:11:04	dbb0	ugly fast example
2011-07-14 14:11:10	dbb0	time for lunch
2011-07-14 14:11:13		[dbb0 away: food]
2011-07-14 14:11:18	nadir	later.

2011-07-14 15:10:48	@telemachus	Hi nadir
2011-07-14 15:10:54	@telemachus	I'll be back in two shakes
2011-07-14 15:11:07	nadir	all cool, i am rather busy too.
2011-07-14 15:11:33	@telemachus	Back
2011-07-14 15:11:44	nadir	now that was fast.
2011-07-14 15:12:12	@telemachus	Yeah, just had to restart something quickly
2011-07-14 15:12:17	@telemachus	can you ping me by name, please
2011-07-14 15:13:40	nadir	ping telemachus
2011-07-14 15:13:46	@telemachus	works
2011-07-14 15:13:48	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-14 15:15:20	nadir	my thread at the forum; if i could get that thing running it would be quite cool.
2011-07-14 15:15:35	nadir	i hump through it, but it gets forward.
2011-07-14 15:15:41	@telemachus	mhmm
2011-07-14 15:15:42	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-14 15:15:47	@telemachus	I like grep
2011-07-14 15:15:49	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-14 15:16:07	nadir	i read about it before you mentioned it, but the explanation was above me.
2011-07-14 15:16:26	nadir	your example seemed more understandable, but i got stuck to fsmithreds solution.
2011-07-14 15:19:13	@telemachus	fair enough
2011-07-14 15:19:57	@telemachus	What are you trying to do here? my $filelist = "@listed_files";
2011-07-14 15:20:17	nadir	that is by fsmith.
2011-07-14 15:20:22	nadir	by that he can compare it with a regex with the file.
2011-07-14 15:20:22	@telemachus	sure
2011-07-14 15:20:28	nadir	(that was not English...)
2011-07-14 15:20:32	@telemachus	but what are you using it for?
2011-07-14 15:20:41	@telemachus	ah, I see
2011-07-14 15:20:54	@telemachus	to make a string of the array and check that against the items
2011-07-14 15:20:54	nadir	see:
2011-07-14 15:20:57	@telemachus	that's foul
2011-07-14 15:21:03	nadir	i put a new picture/thumbnail to the server.
2011-07-14 15:21:14	nadir	then i need to check: is it already in html-file?
2011-07-14 15:21:17	nadir	if no: add it
2011-07-14 15:21:19	@telemachus	right
2011-07-14 15:21:21	@telemachus	I got that
2011-07-14 15:21:23	nadir	without that i have to edit.
2011-07-14 15:21:27	nadir	that is my goal.
2011-07-14 15:21:31	@telemachus	but that's not a good way to do that, I don't think
2011-07-14 15:21:35	@telemachus	I mean, I guess it may work
2011-07-14 15:21:39	nadir	about the how? -> oh my god.
2011-07-14 15:21:40	@telemachus	it's very error prone
2011-07-14 15:21:48	nadir	it seems to work.
2011-07-14 15:21:51	nadir	i see that it is very ugly
2011-07-14 15:21:53	@telemachus	and as the number of files grows
2011-07-14 15:22:10	@telemachus	eventually, you should switch that to be some sort of set operation
2011-07-14 15:22:18	nadir	hmmhh...
2011-07-14 15:22:18	@telemachus	one set is items in file
2011-07-14 15:22:22	nadir	it is for me.
2011-07-14 15:22:25	@telemachus	one set is pictures in the folder
2011-07-14 15:22:34	@telemachus	what's the difference
2011-07-14 15:22:39	@telemachus	that's what you need to work on
2011-07-14 15:22:43	nadir	it supposed to always be 4 pictures per "row"
2011-07-14 15:24:55	nadir	I will re-read what i posted today, and see if i will get better ideas.
2011-07-14 15:25:08	@telemachus	is it not working now?
2011-07-14 15:25:10	nadir	i posted it not cause i like it, but for corrections.
2011-07-14 15:25:15	nadir	i think it works.
2011-07-14 15:25:24	@telemachus	ah, then good
2011-07-14 15:25:31	nadir	-> it does not edit the html file yet, but prints on the screen.
2011-07-14 15:25:38	nadir	but that it does.
2011-07-14 15:25:58	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-14 15:26:22	nadir	yes, so far i am happy that it does something at all.
2011-07-14 15:26:30	nadir	at the end i used one idea by fsmith and one by dbbolton, and i myself did not do much.
2011-07-14 15:29:26	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-14 15:31:42	@telemachus	well, you can work on improving it
2011-07-14 15:31:50	@telemachus	or keep working to understand what it does
2011-07-14 15:36:49	nadir	as far i see that will be my perl-project.
2011-07-14 15:38:08	nadir	the other one will be blosxom
2011-07-14 15:39:31	@telemachus	bloxsom is like a blog engine?
2011-07-14 15:39:55	nadir	yup, and very basic.
2011-07-14 15:40:09	nadir	my blog-> "nadirs words of wisdom"
2011-07-14 15:40:13	nadir	ha ha.
2011-07-14 15:40:23	nadir	but i am not kidding. that will be the name.
2011-07-14 15:40:44	@telemachus	cute
2011-07-14 15:41:58	nadir	and it shortcuts to: wow
2011-07-14 15:42:00	nadir	ha ha ha.
2011-07-14 15:44:19	@telemachus	please tell me that's not how you picked it
2011-07-14 15:44:20	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-14 15:45:03	nadir	no.
2011-07-14 15:45:16	nadir	i just needed something, and it came out of my skull.
2011-07-14 15:45:18	nadir	then i liked it.
2011-07-14 15:45:35	nadir	i needed a <h1>, and it was the first thing.
2011-07-14 15:45:42	nadir	as a joke, sure.
2011-07-14 15:47:18	@telemachus	WOW
2011-07-14 15:49:39		[dbb0 back: gone 01:38:26]
2011-07-14 15:49:56	dbb0	telemachus: did you get the memo about CGI
2011-07-14 15:50:05	@telemachus	I did
2011-07-14 15:50:23	@telemachus	The short answer is that it's a very low-level, buggy, error prone protocol
2011-07-14 15:50:46	@telemachus	Making a website with CGI from scratch in 2011 is like manually flipping bits to search for a string.
2011-07-14 15:53:08	dbb0	i couldn't get mojolicious to do anything.
2011-07-14 15:54:02	@telemachus	huh
2011-07-14 15:54:28	@telemachus	It might require more specific server configuration. Not sure.
2011-07-14 15:54:32	dbb0	copied the hello world example and it didn't work.
2011-07-14 15:54:34	dbb0	500
2011-07-14 15:55:40	dbb0	i feel like my basic cgi script ultimately took less effort than typing out the xhtml by hand
2011-07-14 15:55:57	dbb0	i used markdown inside the script for the meat of the site
2011-07-14 15:56:29	dbb0	i mean page
2011-07-14 15:56:33	@telemachus	right
2011-07-14 15:57:44	dbb0	i just like having it all in one file instead of making a md file, 'compiling' it, then plopping it into some xhtml template
2011-07-14 15:58:26	dbb0	i'm willing to try replacements for cgi, but i just haven't found one yet
2011-07-14 15:58:55	@telemachus	I actually prefer the static-site compiler route, though I can see pros and cons.
2011-07-14 15:59:08	dbb0	you use jekyll, right
2011-07-14 15:59:15	@telemachus	Pros for me: more secure than CGI or PHP or whatever, and the site loads far, far faster
2011-07-14 15:59:23	@telemachus	Cons: extra compilation + rsync steps
2011-07-14 15:59:39	@telemachus	I have used Jekyll (blog still does for the moment), but mostly prefer nanoc now
2011-07-14 15:59:51	@telemachus	It's also Ruby but far more configurable than Jekyll
2011-07-14 16:00:03	@telemachus	But there are lots of good static-site compiler engines
2011-07-14 16:00:12	@telemachus	I think there's even one in bash!
2011-07-14 16:00:49	dbb0	i honestly can't tell a difference in load time between my static xhtml pages and the perl generated ones, but i can imagine the impact on larger pages
2011-07-14 16:01:40	@telemachus	Yeah, fair enough. For a small site with average/normal use, it's probably negligible. I believe that.
2011-07-14 16:02:12	@telemachus	I moved this way because my school was using Wordpress sites for everything.
2011-07-14 16:02:23	@telemachus	And I found for a class website, that slowed down in a hurry.
2011-07-14 16:02:32	@telemachus	So I switched to static-site compilers
2011-07-14 16:03:17	@telemachus	what templating engine are you using? Or just raw markdown to html?
2011-07-14 16:03:38	dbb0	just markdown
2011-07-14 16:05:12	dbb0	my original plan was to have a page's script read a designated template file for sidebars/footers, stuff that would go on every page
2011-07-14 16:05:28	dbb0	then incorporate it into the page
2011-07-14 16:07:02	@telemachus	Yup - pretty common way to modularize a site (templating engines make that not too hard - though I don't know what's state of the art in Perl)
2011-07-14 16:07:38	dbb0	do you know anything about catalyst 
2011-07-14 16:08:49	@telemachus	only that it's huge
2011-07-14 16:08:53	@telemachus	the rails of the perl world
2011-07-14 16:09:17	@telemachus	requires a lot of set up - a database, a template engine, routing, on and on
2011-07-14 16:09:44	@telemachus	Almost certainly overkill for a personal blog - or really anything that's not dynamic
2011-07-14 16:09:59	dbb0	i can't help but think i should have jumped on the ruby train awhile back
2011-07-14 16:10:29	@telemachus	you had started the rails for zombie tutorial, right?
2011-07-14 16:10:49	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-14 16:10:57	dbb0	that's as far as i ever pursued it
2011-07-14 16:11:26	@telemachus	a really good rails tutorial is http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book
2011-07-14 16:11:30	@telemachus	But it's a huge beast
2011-07-14 16:11:44	@telemachus	an alternative for ruby is Sinatra (Dancer is the equivalent for Perl)
2011-07-14 16:11:49	@telemachus	much smaller/lighter/simpler
2011-07-14 16:12:33	dbb0	the dancer hello world looks exactly like mojo
2011-07-14 16:12:52	@telemachus	mhmm, might be
2011-07-14 16:13:03	@telemachus	btw, something you should take a look at: https://www.dotcloud.com/
2011-07-14 16:13:31	@telemachus	You can have a live app for testing. Small ones or the first one normally free on sites like that
2011-07-14 16:13:44	@telemachus	and unlike many/most, they have Perl as well as Ruby and Python and Node
2011-07-14 16:14:05	dbb0	i signed up for some perl cloud a long time ago and i think the company got bought out or something
2011-07-14 16:15:04	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-14 16:15:05	dbb0	have no idea what it was called
2011-07-14 16:15:09	@telemachus	phenona or the like
2011-07-14 16:15:23	@telemachus	I had signed up for a beta invite, they got bought, never heard from them
2011-07-14 16:16:19	dbb0	my big problem with ruby is that when i start learning something i can't get over the "but i can already do this in perl" mentality
2011-07-14 16:17:51	dbb0	so in the short term it seems like i'm wasting my time
2011-07-14 16:19:21	@telemachus	Yeah, I had that as well
2011-07-14 16:20:08	dbb0	plus i already can't remember the syntax for things i know how to do
2011-07-14 16:20:13	@telemachus	However, webdevelopment in Perl seems harder - if only because there's no Heroku for Perl. Dotcloud may change that. They hired the Perl dev responsible for Plack (the Perl Rack-like server)
2011-07-14 16:20:43	dbb0	i just signed up for dotcloud
2011-07-14 16:21:27	dbb0	i was also reading about CGI security issues, and it seems like most of the problems arise from allowing user input in forms
2011-07-14 16:21:45	nadir	for unknown reason i bookmarked this: http://cloudi.org/ and i really don't understand what you both speak of. just check the link
2011-07-14 16:23:32	@telemachus	nadir: Yeah, I remember that
2011-07-14 16:23:45	@telemachus	seems to be a way to run scripts in the cloud, not so much a place to host websites
2011-07-14 16:24:11	@telemachus	dbb0: btw, I think the dotcloud tool requires python to install
2011-07-14 16:24:15	@telemachus	not a big deal, but fyi
2011-07-14 16:24:45	dbb0	i have no problems using a little python now and then
2011-07-14 16:25:00	dbb0	actually my first useful programs were in python
2011-07-14 16:25:33	dbb0	i use the term 'useful' liberally
2011-07-14 16:26:09	@telemachus	I remember your theme-detecting programs from DUF
2011-07-14 16:26:25	@telemachus	My initial view of you was "Python guy"
2011-07-14 16:27:25	dbb0	thank god i shed that stigma
2011-07-14 16:27:29	@telemachus	Not an insult, just what I recall noticing
2011-07-14 16:27:32	dbb0	just kidding
2011-07-14 16:28:50	@telemachus	About every other week I think I should learn Python
2011-07-14 16:29:07	@telemachus	quick question: how does Python handle arrays of arrays?
2011-07-14 16:29:20	dbb0	i should be using it since i'm supposed to be a mathematician
2011-07-14 16:29:32	dbb0	as far as i remember it's similar to perl
2011-07-14 16:29:42	dbb0	you just have multiple indeces 
2011-07-14 16:30:02	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-14 16:30:06	@telemachus	in perl you need refs
2011-07-14 16:30:15	@telemachus	I was hoping Python was like ruby
2011-07-14 16:30:26	@telemachus	array = [[1,2], [3,4]
2011-07-14 16:30:35	dbb0	oh, you mean like an array that has anonymous arrays as elements
2011-07-14 16:30:41	@telemachus	array[0][1] => 2
2011-07-14 16:30:54	@telemachus	Yeah
2011-07-14 16:31:08	dbb0	i think that's how it is in python
2011-07-14 16:31:14	@telemachus	in perl there's no other way to get n-dimensional arrays (Where n > 1)
2011-07-14 16:31:23	@telemachus	ah, cool
2011-07-14 16:31:34	@telemachus	see, that right there is my main dislike in Perl
2011-07-14 16:31:36	@telemachus	references
2011-07-14 16:31:38	@telemachus	they're awful
2011-07-14 16:34:08	dbb0	agreed
2011-07-14 16:34:54	@telemachus	I guess every language has its warts.
2011-07-14 16:38:22	@telemachus	Not sure if you know it (or care), but I thought this was nicely done: http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/ (despite the name)
2011-07-14 16:40:27	dbb0	do you know whether that's 2 or 3
2011-07-14 16:40:55	@telemachus	I'm sorry?
2011-07-14 16:41:10	dbb0	python 2 or python 3
2011-07-14 16:41:15	dbb0	the tutorial
2011-07-14 16:41:18	@telemachus	ah, duh, sorry
2011-07-14 16:41:22	@telemachus	2 I believe
2011-07-14 16:41:49	@telemachus	I can't figure out just how different 3 is
2011-07-14 16:41:58	dbb0	i couldn't tell you
2011-07-14 16:42:00	dbb0	http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
2011-07-14 16:42:03	@telemachus	to me it seems like a lot of little things, but a lot the same
2011-07-14 16:42:15	dbb0	i think that was the last python reference i sed
2011-07-14 16:42:17	dbb0	used*
2011-07-14 16:42:32	dbb0	did you hear about linux 3.0
2011-07-14 16:43:41	@telemachus	yes
2011-07-14 16:43:44	@telemachus	silly
2011-07-14 16:46:11	dbb0	i was excited when i saw the number, and disappointed when i saw the explanation
2011-07-14 16:46:33	@telemachus	exactly
2011-07-14 16:46:52	@telemachus	But I guess that's Linus for you. Sometimes he just makes shit up.
2011-07-14 16:48:40	dbb0	what font are you using in gvim these days?
2011-07-14 16:49:00	@telemachus	consolas I believe
2011-07-14 16:49:10	@telemachus	windows or not, it's a beautiful font
2011-07-14 16:50:30	@telemachus	yup, consolas 14px, mayansmoke for the colorscheme
2011-07-14 16:50:37	dbb0	i use it occasionally
2011-07-14 16:51:07	dbb0	it and monaco look kind of clunky on my debian machine though
2011-07-14 16:51:33	@telemachus	Yeah inter-os font issues boggle me
2011-07-14 16:51:46	@telemachus	osx looks different than debian or windows
2011-07-14 16:52:29	dbb0	can you even change the interface fonts on osx without some kind of hack
2011-07-14 16:52:29	@telemachus	I sometimes use Menlo (a newish osx font), sometimes inconsolata-dz (incolsolata with straight quotes)
2011-07-14 16:52:56	@telemachus	you can change fonts fairly easily in most programs
2011-07-14 16:53:10	@telemachus	it's the desktop manager that you can't muck with
2011-07-14 16:53:17	@telemachus	short of rewiring everything
2011-07-14 16:53:45	nadir	what on earth is a desktop-manager?
2011-07-14 16:53:47	dbb0	inconsolata is what i'm using now
2011-07-14 16:54:44	dbb0	it and dejavu are probably the best looking monospace TTFs available from the main repos imo
2011-07-14 16:54:59	@telemachus	yeah, on linux I often use dejavu
2011-07-14 16:55:13	@telemachus	I think I have it installed here as well, now that I think of it
2011-07-14 16:56:27	dbb0	but it probably looks terrible on osx
2011-07-14 16:57:45	dbb0	it does on windows anyhow
2011-07-14 17:01:33	nadir	i got to run. later (still wondering what a desktop-manager is... :-) )
2011-07-14 17:01:58	dbb0	like explorer.exe
2011-07-14 17:02:05	dbb0	finder
2011-07-14 17:02:09	dbb0	later
2011-07-14 17:02:20	@telemachus	nadir - window/desktop manager
2011-07-14 17:02:28	@telemachus	and later
2011-07-14 17:02:33	nadir	:-)
2011-07-14 17:03:07	@telemachus	deja-vu on osx http://cl.ly/8UQp/o
2011-07-14 17:03:10	@telemachus	not so bad
2011-07-14 17:03:13	@telemachus	consolas is better
2011-07-14 17:03:21	dbb0	telemachus: can you recommend any good CSS resources?
2011-07-14 17:03:24	dbb0	is that bold?
2011-07-14 17:03:33	@telemachus	some of it
2011-07-14 17:03:35	@telemachus	not all of it
2011-07-14 17:04:18	dbb0	it all looks about the same thickness to me
2011-07-14 17:04:51	@telemachus	yeah, true
2011-07-14 17:04:55	@telemachus	this is consolas http://cl.ly/8UB1
2011-07-14 17:04:59	dbb0	it seems like most screenshots of editors and terminals from osx have "fat" fonts
2011-07-14 17:05:18	dbb0	like maybe really light hinting or something
2011-07-14 17:05:29	@telemachus	css I think probably CSS: The Definitive Guide by Eric Meyers is, well, definitive, but the CSS Cookbook is probably more approachable
2011-07-14 17:05:39	@telemachus	both O'Reilly
2011-07-14 17:05:54	@telemachus	For my classes - 9th graders - I use CSS The Missing Manual
2011-07-14 17:06:05	dbb0	anything free?
2011-07-14 17:06:06	@telemachus	You would probably find that too slow, but it's not too bad overall
2011-07-14 17:06:15	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-14 17:06:19	@telemachus	yes, actually

2011-07-14 17:10:28	dbb0	i used rectangular selection to lift the url from weechat and picked up some junk accidentally
2011-07-14 17:10:45	@telemachus	selectors are how you target things to style - apologies if you know that already
2011-07-14 17:10:52	@telemachus	Anything by him is good
2011-07-14 17:11:04	@telemachus	I don't know a comprehensive css tutorial that I would recommend online though
2011-07-14 17:11:16	dbb0	like selector { property: value; }
2011-07-14 17:11:26	dbb0	is that the right use of the term
2011-07-14 17:12:46	@telemachus	exactly
2011-07-14 17:13:52	@telemachus	so for example h1 { font: "DejaVu Sans Mono", monospace;
2011-07-14 17:14:00	@telemachus	damn, hit enter too soon
2011-07-14 17:14:02	@telemachus	but you get the idea

2011-07-15 11:10:33	dbb0	!memo telemachus i might need help with a CSS issue involving multi-line code blocks
2011-07-15 11:10:33	@antinoos	Added memo for telemachus
2011-07-15 11:43:20	@telemachus	dbb0: I usually wrap multi-line code blocks in <pre><code> rather than just <code>
2011-07-15 11:43:20	@antinoos	<dbb0/#study-group/2011-07-15> i might need help with a CSS issue involving multi-line code blocks
2011-07-15 11:43:45	@telemachus	Also, you have to remember to remove all leading indentation from the HTML itself
2011-07-15 11:45:21	dbb0	it has to do with padding not being applied to subsequent lines
2011-07-15 11:45:55	dbb0	when i use a div.code box, it works as i want, but <pre><code> causes problems
2011-07-15 11:46:19	dbb0	http://demus.co/
2011-07-15 11:46:25	dbb0	http://demus.co/css/dark.css
2011-07-15 11:47:11	dbb0	i tried using literal line breaks as well as <br />
2011-07-15 11:47:14	dbb0	same result
2011-07-15 11:47:46	@telemachus	first, you should not need !important for those font-family declarations
2011-07-15 11:47:53	@telemachus	that's already a sign something is wrong
2011-07-15 11:48:22	@telemachus	second, you should ditch the * selector
2011-07-15 11:48:26	@telemachus	start from body
2011-07-15 11:49:29	dbb0	then how do you make the background in and out of the body different colors?
2011-07-15 11:49:47	@telemachus	the body is everything in the viewport
2011-07-15 11:50:15	@telemachus	if you want an inner window with some other color, set a div with a class of "container" or "main" or the like
2011-07-15 11:50:40	@telemachus	also, I don't think that you want your <pre><code> inside a <p>
2011-07-15 11:50:49	@telemachus	<pre> is a block-level element
2011-07-15 11:50:55	@telemachus	no need to put a paragraph around it
2011-07-15 11:51:05	dbb0	well * is set to #303030 which is outside the orange border that goes around the body
2011-07-15 11:51:40	dbb0	and the body is #20202 which is inside the orange border
2011-07-15 11:51:57	dbb0	the lighter gray space is created by the margin
2011-07-15 11:52:06	dbb0	so i don't think it has a selector
2011-07-15 11:53:38	@telemachus	right, but I guess I'm saying that the normal way to do that is with divs inside body
2011-07-15 11:53:59	@telemachus	in any case, here's what I do for code blocks: http://ithaca.arpinum.org/css/code.css
2011-07-15 11:54:14	@telemachus	Some of that is unnecessary for you, since I use a very severe reset
2011-07-15 11:54:31	@telemachus	http://ithaca.arpinum.org/css/reset.css
2011-07-15 11:54:52	@telemachus	so I've "undone" all the default settings for pre - hence I have to reset the whitespace to "pre" (oddly enough)
2011-07-15 11:55:49	@telemachus	Here's the HTML: https://gist.github.com/1084952
2011-07-15 11:55:56	@telemachus	(or the source of same)
2011-07-15 11:56:56	dbb0	what about inline code
2011-07-15 11:58:10	@telemachus	yup, that I handle in the larger css file http://ithaca.arpinum.org/css/screen.css
2011-07-15 11:58:35	@telemachus	though, all I do there is set the font: code { font-family: Consolas, Mensch, Menlo, Monaco, "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono", monospace;
2011-07-15 11:58:38	@telemachus	}
2011-07-15 11:58:55	dbb0	then make it smaller by a factor of .8
2011-07-15 11:59:17	dbb0	along with p
2011-07-15 12:00:10	@telemachus	yes, true
2011-07-15 12:00:21	@telemachus	wait: p code isn't p, code
2011-07-15 12:00:36	@telemachus	that is, it applies to code text inside a p, not p and code
2011-07-15 12:00:40	@telemachus	p, code = both
2011-07-15 12:01:21	@telemachus	but yeah, code inline is only 80% as large as other paragraph fonts (it works out since the monospace fonts otherwise look much larger)
2011-07-15 12:01:39	dbb0	i see
2011-07-15 12:03:24	@telemachus	a space between two selectors signals descendant - the comma means "and"
2011-07-15 12:03:43	@telemachus	so pre, code means style them both the same
2011-07-15 12:03:56	@telemachus	pre code means style any code that is inside a pre block some way...
2011-07-15 12:04:34	@telemachus	http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200509/css_21_selectors_part_1/
2011-07-15 12:04:44	@telemachus	That article is pretty good about that sort of thing
2011-07-15 12:20:22	@telemachus	I'm not sure if I answered your question...
2011-07-15 13:03:31	dbb0	i still don't understand why line breaks are handled differently between div.code and <pre><code>, but it doesn't really matter since the former does what i expect
2011-07-15 13:03:54	dbb0	i don't see any reason why using it would be "wrong"
2011-07-15 13:07:19	@telemachus	<pre><code> should maintain exact whitespace - linebreaks included
2011-07-15 13:08:14	@telemachus	and I guess I don't think it's really wrong, but it's creating a class "code" where a tag/element already exists. That seems redundant to me.
2011-07-15 13:09:39	dbb0	it would be redundant if they did the same thing
2011-07-15 13:10:03	dbb0	but i'm not getting consistent padding on the left side with pre-code
2011-07-15 13:11:00	dbb0	the first line has extra padding
2011-07-15 13:12:49	@telemachus	ok, but my point is that probably has something to do with the raw HTML
2011-07-15 13:13:01	@telemachus	<pre> is very sensitive to what you give it (that's what it's made for)
2011-07-15 13:14:44	dbb0	right
2011-07-15 13:16:05	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1085089
2011-07-15 13:16:23	dbb0	there's no whitespace between <pre> and the first line of code text
2011-07-15 13:17:02	@telemachus	remove the <p> tag
2011-07-15 13:17:11	@telemachus	from around <pre><code>
2011-07-15 13:18:16	dbb0	didn't change it
2011-07-15 13:18:53	@telemachus	hmm, ok, now I'm truly confused
2011-07-15 13:19:04	@telemachus	can you gist/post the full css + html files?
2011-07-15 13:19:08	@telemachus	I want to view them locally
2011-07-15 13:19:46	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-15 13:22:46	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1085110
2011-07-15 13:23:50	dbb0	here's a screenshot of the local file(s) as seen in my browser
2011-07-15 13:24:00	dbb0	http://i.imgur.com/84ez4.png
2011-07-15 13:24:30	dbb0	it looks like the first line also has more vertical padding
2011-07-15 13:25:45	@telemachus	Ok, let me copy and load here locally, give me a few mins, please
2011-07-15 13:31:49	@telemachus	Just noticed: your HTML is invalid. There's a <p> element before <h1> that closes after the </ul>. Something in your templater/markdown script?
2011-07-15 13:31:53	@telemachus	Still checking out the rest
2011-07-15 13:32:45	@telemachus	Ok, without any CSS - here it is http://cl.ly/8TFl
2011-07-15 13:33:01	@telemachus	The pre section works, no extra space and the <br> works (but is unnecessary)
2011-07-15 13:33:05	dbb0	yeah, basically the same for me except fonts
2011-07-15 13:33:08	@telemachus	let me add style
2011-07-15 13:33:23	@telemachus	but my point is that <pre><code> doesn't add extra space (yet)
2011-07-15 13:33:50	dbb0	right
2011-07-15 13:35:07	dbb0	the <p> thing is a cgi problem
2011-07-15 13:37:12	dbb0	you have to use an existing method on your cgi object
2011-07-15 13:37:48	dbb0	i haven't been able to figure out how to say "i have this html that's ready to go. drop it into my document and don't wrap any tags around it."
2011-07-15 13:40:10	dbb0	headsmack
2011-07-15 13:41:07	dbb0	i just had to change $query->p("$md"), to $md, (it's in a list of items in a print statement)
2011-07-15 13:46:44	@telemachus	Found it: https://gist.github.com/1085147
2011-07-15 13:46:49	@telemachus	The problem was the code block
2011-07-15 13:46:59	@telemachus	it was being applied to <pre><code> as well
2011-07-15 13:47:12	@telemachus	change it to p code and it only applies to code inside paragraphs
2011-07-15 13:47:39	@telemachus	(Also a few typos in the CSS - missing colon and italic is font-family, not text-decoration)
2011-07-15 13:49:18	@telemachus	http://cl.ly/8TA1
2011-07-15 13:54:03	dbb0	where was the missing ;
2011-07-15 13:58:51	@telemachus	colon, not semi
2011-07-15 13:59:01	@telemachus	line 66 maybe?
2011-07-15 13:59:04	@telemachus	one sec
2011-07-15 13:59:37	@telemachus	Here's how I found it: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload
2011-07-15 13:59:44	@telemachus	but let me check your gist again
2011-07-15 14:00:09	@telemachus	yeah, line 66 line-height         1.5;
2011-07-15 14:00:13	@telemachus	no colon
2011-07-15 14:01:08	dbb0	thanks
2011-07-15 14:02:40	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-15 14:02:52	@telemachus	and the other issue is line 58
2011-07-15 14:03:09	@telemachus	you want font-style
2011-07-15 14:03:54	dbb0	got it
2011-07-15 14:04:34	dbb0	also fixed the validation issue, so it's valid xhtml 1.0 strict now
2011-07-15 14:04:38	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-15 14:04:55	@telemachus	Though, fyi, I recommend either HTML 4.01 or HTML 5 - really 5
2011-07-15 14:05:05	@telemachus	fuck trailing slashes
2011-07-15 14:05:07	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-15 14:05:23	dbb0	BLASPHEMY 
2011-07-15 14:05:40	dbb0	html5 is too scary
2011-07-15 14:06:31	dbb0	what don't you like about xhtml strict?
2011-07-15 14:06:32	@telemachus	balls
2011-07-15 14:06:46	@telemachus	I've been using html5 for new sites since a year and change at least
2011-07-15 14:06:48	@telemachus	it's golden
2011-07-15 14:06:52	@telemachus	xhtml is bullshit
2011-07-15 14:06:59	@telemachus	turning nice, clean html into quasi xml
2011-07-15 14:07:15	dbb0	i don't get it
2011-07-15 14:07:16	@telemachus	what broke the camel's back for me was this article - one sec
2011-07-15 14:07:43	@telemachus	http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml
2011-07-15 14:08:09	@telemachus	basically you are doing extra work to write xhtml
2011-07-15 14:08:16	@telemachus	but then you serve it as text/html
2011-07-15 14:08:21	@telemachus	which defeats the whole purpose
2011-07-15 14:08:26	@telemachus	but if you try to serve it as xhtml
2011-07-15 14:08:31	@telemachus	no browser in the world will read it
2011-07-15 14:08:34	@telemachus	ta dah!
2011-07-15 14:15:53	dbb0	works in iceweasel
2011-07-15 14:16:19	 *	telemachus sighs
2011-07-15 14:16:21	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-15 14:16:49	@telemachus	I can only say that I am pretty sure you are on the wrong side of history. That is, the XHTML vs HTML battle finished a few years ago. HTML won.
2011-07-15 14:17:35	@telemachus	XHTML2 is officially dead. And people aren't extending support for the syntax so far as I know.
2011-07-15 14:20:31	dbb0	i don't think i ever said "xhtml version X is better than html version Y"
2011-07-15 14:22:51	dbb0	i actually learned about xml before i started playing around with web pages, so i'm partial to it
2011-07-15 14:23:02	@telemachus	No, I know. I'm not disputing it. I just meant the act of writing XHTML at this point is foolish. It's a dead branch on the tree, so to speak.
2011-07-15 14:23:15	@telemachus	Ah, but that does make sense if you like xml already or know it.
2011-07-15 14:23:38	@telemachus	I really dislike it. Verbose like its daddy, Java.
2011-07-15 14:23:44	dbb0	i might agree with the 'foolish' label if i were doing something that mattered.
2011-07-15 14:24:07	@telemachus	dbb0: Fair enough. And I'm being pretty dogmatic and unhelpful.
2011-07-15 14:24:40	@telemachus	I just really think HTML is a lovely, simple markup. I dislike a lot of the "improvements" out there.
2011-07-15 14:25:25	dbb0	i also haven't actually tried html5 so i can't really comment on it
2011-07-15 14:26:04	@telemachus	It's pretty great. Here's my one-line sales pitch: This is the doctype - <!DOCTYPE html>
2011-07-15 14:26:14	@telemachus	short enough to actually memorize and type.
2011-07-15 14:26:42	@telemachus	and it adds a bunch of useful semantic divs: <header> <footer> <section> <article>
2011-07-15 14:27:03	dbb0	so there aren't alternate DTDs
2011-07-15 14:27:10	@telemachus	correct
2011-07-15 14:27:47	@telemachus	If you're curious, here's a good free book: http://diveintohtml5.org/
2011-07-15 14:30:24	dbb0	it looks like there is an xml serialization of html5 too
2011-07-15 14:30:44	@telemachus	yes, if you are addicted to the space+/ you can do it
2011-07-15 14:30:52	@telemachus	but the other kids will make fun of you
2011-07-15 14:31:04	@telemachus	both <br> and <br /> are valid for html5
2011-07-15 14:31:23	@telemachus	to help all the people who were writing XHTML for all those years
2011-07-15 14:36:20	dbb0	does html5 forgive things like improperly nested or unclosed elements
2011-07-15 14:36:43	@telemachus	forgive? No, but it doesn't have draconian error handling
2011-07-15 14:38:33	dbb0	what kind of error handling does it have then
2011-07-15 14:39:17	@telemachus	Same as all HTML - browser does the best it can. If the page is invalid, no guarantees are made and you're likely to get a poorly rendered page.
2011-07-15 14:39:18	dbb0	sensitive?
2011-07-15 14:39:33	@telemachus	case sensitive you mean?
2011-07-15 14:39:42	dbb0	no, it was a joke
2011-07-15 14:40:02	dbb0	like it tries to be nice to you
2011-07-15 14:40:48	dbb0	as opposed to being harsh
2011-07-15 14:41:02	@telemachus	ah, gotcha
2011-07-15 14:41:04	@telemachus	I'm slow
2011-07-15 14:41:15	@telemachus	but that was always a sticking point with XHTML2
2011-07-15 14:41:24	@telemachus	it was supposed to have draconian error handling
2011-07-15 14:41:36	@telemachus	(That's how it's always described - not me being a classics geek.)
2011-07-15 14:41:52	@telemachus	If you have a single missing /, then you're whole site doesn't render.
2011-07-15 14:42:03	@telemachus	Visitors get an error-filled browser
2011-07-15 14:42:22	@telemachus	You can imagine that webdevs and business people weren't happy
2011-07-15 14:42:28	dbb0	i actually prefer the stricter rules of well-formedness 
2011-07-15 14:43:07	dbb0	i don't expect perl to forgive a single missing ;
2011-07-15 14:44:08	dbb0	or the shell a missing quote mark
2011-07-15 14:45:06	dbb0	i think more forgiveness can lead to sloppy 'programming'
2011-07-15 14:45:21	@telemachus	maybe so
2011-07-15 14:45:37	@telemachus	the thing is that HTML was never meant to be a true programming language or only for programmers
2011-07-15 14:46:11	@telemachus	Also, it's already in the state it's in. If we switched to severe error handling tomorrow, 60-70% of the web would be off-line.
2011-07-15 14:46:25	@telemachus	ANd I'm not just talking rinky-dink sites: Google, NYTimes, on and on.
2011-07-15 14:46:35	@telemachus	They all have multiple warnings and errors if you validate them.
2011-07-15 14:47:02	dbb0	again, i was just stating my preference, not what i think everyone should do
2011-07-15 14:48:22	dbb0	i'm definitely not going to hurt anybody by following draconian syntax rules in my pages
2011-07-15 14:48:32	dbb0	maybe myself
2011-07-15 14:58:30	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-15 14:58:33	@telemachus	no, nothing wrong
2011-07-15 14:58:45	@telemachus	I'm just saying why the w3c can't really go hard on that
2011-07-15 15:01:00	dbb0	do you know of anyway to use javascript to convert md to html on the fly?
2011-07-15 15:01:06	dbb0	any way*
2011-07-15 15:01:41	@telemachus	yeah, there is such a library I believe
2011-07-15 15:01:47	dbb0	cool
2011-07-15 15:01:54	@telemachus	can't recall it's name, but google for markdown and javascript
2011-07-15 15:02:06	@telemachus	there's also a reverser - show html as markdown
2011-07-15 15:02:10	@telemachus	which I think is even cooler
2011-07-15 15:02:12	dbb0	i probably should have done that in the first place
2011-07-15 15:03:13	dbb0	what about ruby
2011-07-15 15:04:41	dbb0	i just really like the idea of a script generating a web page.
2011-07-15 15:05:12	dbb0	but i hate cgi
2011-07-15 15:06:33	@telemachus	http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/
2011-07-15 15:06:48	@telemachus	That might be an editor though.
2011-07-15 15:37:15	dbb0	i've decided that i'll never have any use for mojolicious
2011-07-15 15:39:23	@telemachus	that bad, huh?
2011-07-15 15:48:31	dbb0	not bad, just inappropriate
2011-07-15 15:49:19	dbb0	you have to run the program as a daemon on a certain port
2011-07-15 15:49:38	dbb0	as far as i can tell
2011-07-15 15:50:03	dbb0	and it seems like it's mainly for handling forms
2011-07-15 15:51:36	dbb0	not generating a basic webpage
2011-07-15 15:52:27	@telemachus	dbb0: It's for web applications not regular websites, I suppose
2011-07-15 15:53:07	@telemachus	Ok, I need to log out of here
2011-07-15 15:53:10	@telemachus	See you later

2011-07-16 12:59:59	nadir	once you posted it sounded so nice and easy, but i for one could not find that/your solution.

2011-07-16 13:20:50	nadir	if you have been here, sorry.
2011-07-16 13:20:53	fsmithred	I can only check my email about once a day

2011-07-16 13:21:49	nadir	i for one got problems with refractasnapshot.
2011-07-16 13:21:53	nadir	i told him it might be me.
2011-07-16 13:21:59	fsmithred	what problem?s
2011-07-16 13:22:01	nadir	its the user "dasein"
2011-07-16 13:22:07	nadir	it does not make a snapshot.
2011-07-16 13:22:12	nadir	I tried all versions.
2011-07-16 13:22:20	nadir	from github, from iso, from whereever
2011-07-16 13:22:27	fsmithred	got enough space?
2011-07-16 13:22:31	nadir	yup.
2011-07-16 13:22:34	nadir	more than enough.
2011-07-16 13:22:41	fsmithred	any error messages
2011-07-16 13:22:43	nadir	there once has been a thread about it.
2011-07-16 13:22:45	nadir	nope.
2011-07-16 13:22:56	nadir	it runs through, and the result is  a few kB
2011-07-16 13:23:10	fsmithred	omg, my compuer beeps with every letter I type
2011-07-16 13:23:12	fsmithred	just started
2011-07-16 13:23:19	nadir	if it works for you, all is good.
2011-07-16 13:23:27	nadir	in that case its only me. no problem.
2011-07-16 13:23:31	fsmithred	wtf?
2011-07-16 13:23:36	fsmithred	yeah, it works
2011-07-16 13:23:46	nadir	modprobe -r pcspkr
2011-07-16 13:23:48	nadir	?
2011-07-16 13:23:58	nadir	ok, if its me its me.
2011-07-16 13:24:20	nadir	right now i ain't got enough time to investigate more deeply.
2011-07-16 13:24:46	nadir	you took a stock refracta-6.0.5-iso as a "base" ?
2011-07-16 13:25:09	nadir	with investigating deeply i mean checking code/commands/etc.
2011-07-16 13:25:25	nadir	i looked at the python-code, and it gave me headaches...
2011-07-16 13:25:48	fsmithred	oh, I haven't used deans snapshot tool in awhile
2011-07-16 13:26:12	nadir	i also tried your github-version.
2011-07-16 13:27:51	fsmithred	oh, thanks for modprobe
2011-07-16 13:27:53	fsmithred	that worked
2011-07-16 13:28:01	fsmithred	was just doing it in xchat
2011-07-16 13:28:04	fsmithred	not in terminal
2011-07-16 13:28:19	fsmithred	you get a small iso?
2011-07-16 13:28:24	nadir	yup
2011-07-16 13:28:34	nadir	small in the meaning of tiny.
2011-07-16 13:28:43	fsmithred	something maybe is killing the program early
2011-07-16 13:28:58	fsmithred	I ran into that, and I think I changed it and uploaded to github
2011-07-16 13:29:07	fsmithred	couple weeks ago
2011-07-16 13:29:08	nadir	i can try again.
2011-07-16 13:29:13	nadir	yes, i remember.
2011-07-16 13:29:23	nadir	wait, let me look at your github.
2011-07-16 13:30:34	nadir	puh, iceweasel 5 arrived today in sid. Now that is a pain.
2011-07-16 13:31:02	fsmithred	try nogui-0.04
2011-07-16 13:31:05	nadir	ah, ok. you got three codes.
2011-07-16 13:31:10	nadir	ah, ok. let me write that down.
2011-07-16 13:31:30	nadir	as i prefer the cli (or trust it more), i sure have chosen that one.
2011-07-16 13:31:33	nadir	will do again.
2011-07-16 13:31:49	nadir	like said: as no one else complains all is good. no need for you to think about it.
2011-07-16 13:32:01	fsmithred	I removed the -x from rsync
2011-07-16 13:32:14	fsmithred	so if you have any extra drives mounted, they'll get copied
2011-07-16 13:32:19	fsmithred	unless you unmount them
2011-07-16 13:32:31	nadir	yes, i remember you explained something like that to me.
2011-07-16 13:32:44	nadir	i never fully understood it. the -x did not hurt, as far i can tell.
2011-07-16 13:33:24	nadir	the user "dasein" seems quite experiences, so he will find his way (i hope)
2011-07-16 13:33:30	fsmithred	take the config file and the excludes file from git
2011-07-16 13:33:44	fsmithred	new excludes
2011-07-16 13:33:48	fsmithred	config file is optional
2011-07-16 13:34:00	fsmithred	um
2011-07-16 13:34:16	fsmithred	you might need to edit the script to point to the config file and the excludes file
2011-07-16 13:34:22	fsmithred	or put them in the right places
2011-07-16 13:34:49	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-16 13:35:00	nadir	wait. i did not use the excludes file. that i know for sure.
2011-07-16 13:35:06	nadir	i simply downloaded the script.
2011-07-16 13:35:07	fsmithred	script in my local git repo says /home/user/refractasnapshot.conf
2011-07-16 13:35:15	fsmithred	not sure if git is up to date on that
2011-07-16 13:35:22	nadir	ok.
2011-07-16 13:35:36	nadir	so i will pick all the three, and put all of them in /home/user
2011-07-16 13:35:42	fsmithred	I was havning trouble iwth the excludes
2011-07-16 13:35:45	nadir	check where it points to. and then see.
2011-07-16 13:35:46	fsmithred	so I rewrote it
2011-07-16 13:36:14	nadir	right now i am running a VBox install, so i can't check right now.
2011-07-16 13:36:15	fsmithred	look in the config file
2011-07-16 13:36:56	fsmithred	and if $save_work=yes...
2011-07-16 13:37:06	fsmithred	disk space report will be misleading
2011-07-16 13:37:33	nadir	so?
2011-07-16 13:37:34	fsmithred	you don't need 66% free space if the system copy is already made
2011-07-16 13:41:02	nadir	so do i have to change $save_work ?
2011-07-16 13:42:27	nadir	anyway: here is the thread: http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=66790
2011-07-16 13:42:31	fsmithred	am I still here?

2011-07-16 13:42:32	fsmithred	hi again
2011-07-16 13:42:33	fsmithred	did you try my $scalar = "@array" vs. my $scalar = @array
2011-07-16 13:42:33	fsmithred	second one just gives you the number of elements
2011-07-16 13:42:42	nadir	perfect.
2011-07-16 13:42:45	nadir	thanks a ton.
2011-07-16 13:43:08	nadir	i did not look that close, i simply copied/pasted.
2011-07-16 13:43:09	fsmithred	make it yes or no
2011-07-16 13:43:11	fsmithred	in the config file
2011-07-16 13:43:14	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-16 13:43:23	fsmithred	with quotes it gives you a string of words
2011-07-16 13:43:27	fsmithred	whatever is in the list
2011-07-16 13:43:45	fsmithred	then test for the pattern in that string
2011-07-16 13:43:52	nadir	your solution did work. (i think we speak of the perl-voodoo, right?)
2011-07-16 13:43:58	fsmithred	pattern iterates through all the files listed in the text file
2011-07-16 13:44:07	fsmithred	yes, perl voodoo
2011-07-16 13:44:23	nadir	we could do that as a project, if you like.
2011-07-16 13:44:31	fsmithred	do what?
2011-07-16 13:44:37	nadir	i am at it, but the last tow days i was tired.
2011-07-16 13:44:40	fsmithred	stick pins into a script and see if it dies?
2011-07-16 13:44:44	nadir	ok, what i want is this:
2011-07-16 13:44:45	nadir	lol.
2011-07-16 13:45:06	nadir	i got two dirs -> yada/gallery/pictures yada/gallery/thumbnails.
2011-07-16 13:45:10	nadir	i got a html file.
2011-07-16 13:45:15	nadir	what i want with perl is:
2011-07-16 13:45:36	nadir	check if all pictures of the path are added to the html-file
2011-07-16 13:45:42	nadir	if not: add them under "new"
2011-07-16 13:45:52	nadir	its not super hard, but still above me.
2011-07-16 13:46:03	nadir	i did it with a) your idea, and b)...
2011-07-16 13:46:10	nadir	<!--placeholder-->
2011-07-16 13:46:20	fsmithred	waht is that placeholder thing?
2011-07-16 13:46:32	nadir	and then with s/<!--placeholder-->/new_entry/
2011-07-16 13:46:47	nadir	<!-- starts a comment, so the website will not show it.
2011-07-16 13:47:03	nadir	i try to use s /substitute/
2011-07-16 13:47:05	nadir	to say:
2011-07-16 13:47:30	nadir	replace the placeholder with the new entry and again a line which says <!placeholder>
2011-07-16 13:47:34	nadir	got me?
2011-07-16 13:47:40	nadir	i got problems to explain it.
2011-07-16 13:47:54	nadir	i posted what i got in the thread, but now am stuck.
2011-07-16 13:48:25	fsmithred	foreach (@pictures) {
2011-07-16 13:48:25	fsmithred		if ($filelist !~ /$_/) {
2011-07-16 13:48:25	fsmithred			push @missing_files, $_;
2011-07-16 13:48:34	fsmithred	add a line to that, or change it
2011-07-16 13:48:39	fsmithred	instead of push...
2011-07-16 13:48:40	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-16 13:48:42	nadir	and then
2011-07-16 13:48:53	nadir	foreach (@missing_files)
2011-07-16 13:48:53	fsmithred	um
2011-07-16 13:48:59	fsmithred	you don't need to copy the file, right?
2011-07-16 13:49:07	fsmithred	just add the entry to the html file?
2011-07-16 13:49:08	nadir	s/<!--placholder-->/new_entry/
2011-07-16 13:49:15	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-16 13:49:30	nadir	thats why i use placeholder, so i got a place _where_ to put it.
2011-07-16 13:49:58	nadir	so:
2011-07-16 13:50:10	nadir	where now is placeholder, add the missing picture-entry.
2011-07-16 13:50:17	nadir	and add a new line for placeholder.
2011-07-16 13:50:23	nadir	so the next time i can do the same.
2011-07-16 13:50:28	nadir	is that clear? a bit?
2011-07-16 13:50:45	fsmithred	sort of
2011-07-16 13:50:52	fsmithred	I don't really get it
2011-07-16 13:50:57	nadir	mhhh....
2011-07-16 13:51:00	fsmithred	but I think I understand the intent
2011-07-16 13:51:08	fsmithred	you have to add a line to the html file
2011-07-16 13:51:22	nadir	let me try to find the html, and gist it. second
2011-07-16 13:51:28	fsmithred	dilbert suggetsed doing it with html
2011-07-16 13:51:35	fsmithred	I don't know how to do that
2011-07-16 13:51:42	fsmithred	but get it to read and show every file
2011-07-16 13:51:59	nadir	ups, my gist is broken
2011-07-16 13:52:57	fsmithred	ok, he said to use perl to write the body of the html page
2011-07-16 13:53:04	nadir	https://gist.github.com/1086590
2011-07-16 13:53:05	fsmithred	that sounds pretty reasonable
2011-07-16 13:53:22	nadir	go down to the end of the script, there you will find <!--placeholder-->
2011-07-16 13:54:02	fsmithred	I see it
2011-07-16 13:54:37	fsmithred	is it possible in html to make the body live in a separate file?
2011-07-16 13:54:59	nadir	now look here:
2011-07-16 13:55:03	nadir	https://gist.github.com/1086593
2011-07-16 13:55:04	fsmithred	seems like it would be easier
2011-07-16 13:55:37	fsmithred	yeah, but it's going to get replaced after the body tag
2011-07-16 13:55:48	fsmithred	after /body
2011-07-16 13:55:55	fsmithred	how to get it before that?
2011-07-16 13:56:04	nadir	ups.
2011-07-16 13:56:13	fsmithred	that's why I was thinking another file
2011-07-16 13:56:13	nadir	well: just put it in body.
2011-07-16 13:56:17	nadir	no?
2011-07-16 13:56:20	fsmithred	how?
2011-07-16 13:56:31	fsmithred	put the placeholder in the body?
2011-07-16 13:56:38	nadir	sure.
2011-07-16 13:56:42	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 13:56:44	nadir	why not?
2011-07-16 13:56:50	fsmithred	I guess
2011-07-16 13:56:51	nadir	it is an error/a typo.
2011-07-16 13:56:56	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 13:56:58	nadir	that was not my purpose. general confusion.
2011-07-16 13:57:03	fsmithred	it works?
2011-07-16 13:57:43	nadir	that version only prints the result on the screen.
2011-07-16 13:57:50	nadir	i failed to make it write.
2011-07-16 13:57:51	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-16 13:58:01	nadir	but printing it on the screen does work.
2011-07-16 13:58:06	fsmithred	ok, but what dilbert suggested
2011-07-16 13:58:16	fsmithred	instead of looping through to figure out what's missing
2011-07-16 13:58:28	fsmithred	just loop through the directory and add all pics to the html file
2011-07-16 13:58:29	nadir	simply take all. yup, probably a good idea too.
2011-07-16 13:58:52	fsmithred	I did something similar to what you wanted
2011-07-16 13:58:57	nadir	i was very tired (or am). My solution was the first i had.
2011-07-16 13:58:59	nadir	yes?
2011-07-16 13:59:00	fsmithred	to find missing pdf files on a website
2011-07-16 13:59:11	fsmithred	did it with bash, grep, and I think awk
2011-07-16 13:59:15	fsmithred	but not all in one script
2011-07-16 13:59:22	fsmithred	took me most of a day to do it
2011-07-16 13:59:44	fsmithred	also had to connect with ftp and get directory listing
2011-07-16 14:00:31	fsmithred	a lot of it was done manually
2011-07-16 14:00:59	nadir	for me its also a way to learn perl.
2011-07-16 14:01:09	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-16 14:01:15	nadir	i forked around so much that writing it manually is now a piece of cake.
2011-07-16 14:01:21	nadir	much easier than with perl. lol.
2011-07-16 14:01:24	fsmithred	took me awhile to figure out how to search for pattern in array
2011-07-16 14:01:40	fsmithred	I know we discussed it
2011-07-16 14:01:47	fsmithred	but I couldn't find it in either book
2011-07-16 14:01:49	fsmithred	or in my scripts
2011-07-16 14:01:56	nadir	i failed. without your help i would  not have been able to.
2011-07-16 14:01:59	nadir	i went nut here.
2011-07-16 14:02:08	fsmithred	just kept trying stuff until I found a combination that worked
2011-07-16 14:02:35	fsmithred	for i in $(grep $pattern $file2) ; do
2011-07-16 14:02:35	fsmithred	    if ! $(grep -q "$i" $file1) ;
2011-07-16 14:02:35	fsmithred	    then
2011-07-16 14:02:35	fsmithred	      echo "$i" >> not-found.txt
2011-07-16 14:07:54	fsmithred	I think that second gist you showed me is all you need
2011-07-16 14:08:14	nadir	yeah, might be, but i need to figure out how to write to the file.
2011-07-16 14:08:14	fsmithred	maybe don't even need the placeholder
2011-07-16 14:08:20	nadir	instead of to the screen.
2011-07-16 14:08:29	fsmithred	use $output
2011-07-16 14:08:38	fsmithred	hang on, I think I can find a sample
2011-07-16 14:08:44	nadir	cool.
2011-07-16 14:09:17	fsmithred	#open my $output, '>>', 'userdat.txt';
2011-07-16 14:10:20	fsmithred	hm
2011-07-16 14:10:22	nadir	but >> is append, or not?
2011-07-16 14:10:29	fsmithred	not sure how to modify this
2011-07-16 14:10:46	nadir	that is what i try to work around with <!placeholder>
2011-07-16 14:10:59	nadir	and s/la/lu/
2011-07-16 14:11:21	fsmithred			my @keys = keys %userinfo;				# print key/value pairs
2011-07-16 14:11:21	fsmithred			my @values = values %userinfo;
2011-07-16 14:11:21	fsmithred				while (@keys) {
2011-07-16 14:11:21	fsmithred				print pop(@keys), ': ', pop(@values), "\n";
2011-07-16 14:11:21	fsmithred				# comment the above line and
2011-07-16 14:11:22	fsmithred				# uncomment the next line to print to file
2011-07-16 14:11:24	fsmithred				#print $output pop(@keys), ': ', pop(@values), "\n"
2011-07-16 14:11:53	fsmithred	print $output @pics
2011-07-16 14:11:58	fsmithred	?
2011-07-16 14:12:14	nadir	sorry, you lost me.
2011-07-16 14:12:16	nadir	:-)
2011-07-16 14:12:22	dbb0	usually you don't pass an array directly to print
2011-07-16 14:12:36	nadir	what?
2011-07-16 14:12:47	nadir	my book says something else...
2011-07-16 14:13:08	dbb0	well i dont anyway
2011-07-16 14:13:23	fsmithred	ok, how to add lines to a file
2011-07-16 14:13:31	fsmithred	each line has some different values
2011-07-16 14:13:43	fsmithred	different file for href
2011-07-16 14:13:56	dbb0	perl -e '@a=qw/ a b c d/; print @a;' --> abcd
2011-07-16 14:14:11	dbb0	i usually like space/newline padding
2011-07-16 14:14:41	dbb0	say for @a; or print "$_ " for @a;
2011-07-16 14:15:13	fsmithred	list all the files in a directory
2011-07-16 14:15:13	nadir	ah, ok. yeah, the book says it like that.
2011-07-16 14:15:21	nadir	(i think in qoutas)
2011-07-16 14:15:28	fsmithred	foreach picture, add a line to the html file
2011-07-16 14:15:57	fsmithred	right now, that involves replacing some text in the body of the html file
2011-07-16 14:16:06	fsmithred	but appending a line would be good
2011-07-16 14:16:13	fsmithred	well...
2011-07-16 14:16:16	fsmithred	appending it to the body
2011-07-16 14:16:47	dbb0	nadir: i guess my varibale substituion example didnt work?
2011-07-16 14:16:57	nadir	yes, it worked perfect.
2011-07-16 14:17:03	fsmithred	how to do echo "some text" >> file
2011-07-16 14:17:05	fsmithred	in perl?
2011-07-16 14:17:14	nadir	but i only got as far as printing it to the screen. Not to print it to the file.
2011-07-16 14:17:21	nadir	its the last step which is missing.
2011-07-16 14:17:35	nadir	no biggie, i guess, but for a beginner, with some problems.
2011-07-16 14:17:49	dbb0	fsmithred: you set the >> option when you declare your filehandle
2011-07-16 14:17:54	fsmithred	I think it's in a chpater we didn't cover yet
2011-07-16 14:18:04	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 14:18:15	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1086593
2011-07-16 14:18:18	dbb0	open(my $log, ">>", "my.log");
2011-07-16 14:18:19	fsmithred	that's what he has now
2011-07-16 14:18:35	fsmithred	and there's a placeholder in the html file
2011-07-16 14:18:36	dbb0	print $log "my text";
2011-07-16 14:18:42	fsmithred	ah
2011-07-16 14:19:44	dbb0	perldoc perlintro
2011-07-16 14:19:48	dbb0	it's in there
2011-07-16 14:20:26	dbb0	files and i/o
2011-07-16 14:20:33	nadir	so far, so good (so what?)
2011-07-16 14:20:51	fsmithred	print $replacement "$gallery_html";
2011-07-16 14:20:52	nadir	if i got my array, lets call it @missing_files.
2011-07-16 14:21:07	nadir	and if i got my placeholder, say <!-- placeholder -->
2011-07-16 14:21:13	dbb0	fsmithred: is $replacement a filehandle
2011-07-16 14:21:16	nadir	how do i use s/la/lu
2011-07-16 14:21:17	fsmithred	no
2011-07-16 14:21:18	nadir	?
2011-07-16 14:21:22	nadir	there i failed.
2011-07-16 14:21:22	fsmithred	gallery_html is
2011-07-16 14:21:24	fsmithred	well
2011-07-16 14:21:33	fsmithred	it was the input file in the original example
2011-07-16 14:21:37	fsmithred	but it should be the output file
2011-07-16 14:21:56	fsmithred	replacement is the text
2011-07-16 14:22:01	nadir	can i simply do something like (ignore syntax)
2011-07-16 14:22:02	fsmithred	oh, I got it backward
2011-07-16 14:22:08	dbb0	fsmithred: that wont work
2011-07-16 14:22:10	nadir	foreach (@missing_files)
2011-07-16 14:22:30	nadir	print s/<!--plachodler-->/your_replacement/
2011-07-16 14:22:31	fsmithred	print $output_file "some_text"
2011-07-16 14:22:33	dbb0	nadir: https://gist.github.com/1080666
2011-07-16 14:22:45	nadir	one the filehandle is open? Let me check your gist. thanks
2011-07-16 14:23:16	nadir	yeah, that works.
2011-07-16 14:23:17	dbb0	what exactly are you trying to do
2011-07-16 14:23:30	nadir	ok. let me try.
2011-07-16 14:23:41	nadir	i got a html-file which shows pictures. nothing else
2011-07-16 14:23:53	nadir	i got two directories: pictures and thumbnails.
2011-07-16 14:24:04	nadir	i check if all pictures are mentioned in the html-file
2011-07-16 14:24:21	nadir	if one is not in the html-file, add it to an array, say @missing_files.
2011-07-16 14:24:29	nadir	then i want to loop over @missing files
2011-07-16 14:24:38	nadir	and write each to the html-file.
2011-07-16 14:24:52	nadir	i got a line called <!--placeholder-->
2011-07-16 14:25:01	nadir	i want to replace that line, like in your gist.
2011-07-16 14:25:07	nadir	is that clear?
2011-07-16 14:25:40	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-16 14:25:48	nadir	ok. so, so far it works.
2011-07-16 14:25:59	nadir	-> writing the result to the screen.
2011-07-16 14:26:04	nadir	now i open a filehandle:
2011-07-16 14:26:11	dbb0	oh
2011-07-16 14:26:26	nadir	open (my $ofh, '>', "my_html")
2011-07-16 14:26:34	dbb0	you need to copy file.html to file.html.orig
2011-07-16 14:26:44	nadir	yeah, got that.
2011-07-16 14:26:46	dbb0	open a file called file.html.tmp
2011-07-16 14:26:51	nadir	can i now do:
2011-07-16 14:26:52	dbb0	for writing only
2011-07-16 14:27:16	nadir	print $ofh s/<!--placholder>/$replacement/
2011-07-16 14:27:17	nadir	?
2011-07-16 14:27:31	nadir	that is the missing piece, so to speak.
2011-07-16 14:29:13	dbb0	hold on a sec
2011-07-16 14:29:21	fsmithred	will it only add one file that way?
2011-07-16 14:29:49	fsmithred	how about - print the header to file
2011-07-16 14:29:56	fsmithred	print a line for each picture to file
2011-07-16 14:30:01	fsmithred	print the footer to file
2011-07-16 14:30:04	nadir	i would do it in a loop, say: foreach (@missing_files) { like above }
2011-07-16 14:31:35	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1086620
2011-07-16 14:32:11	dbb0	you can't read from and write to file.html at the same time, which is why you use file.html.tmp as an intermediate
2011-07-16 14:32:17	dbb0	same thing with sed
2011-07-16 14:32:27	nadir	ah, ok. got you.
2011-07-16 14:32:38	nadir	the book said something like that, but was not as clear as you are.
2011-07-16 14:32:45	nadir	i will try that.
2011-07-16 14:32:47	nadir	thanks a ton.
2011-07-16 14:33:17	dbb0	no problem
2011-07-16 14:35:13	dbb0	telemachus calls that the old switcheroo
2011-07-16 14:36:26	dbb0	if there's only going to be one placeholder per line, you won't need the /g
2011-07-16 14:36:33	nadir	k
2011-07-16 14:36:52	nadir	in general it is rather easy. I want it for me, and it will be very easy.
2011-07-16 14:37:18	nadir	one subject (say "me", "screenshots", "art") and per subject four pictures.
2011-07-16 14:37:28	nadir	and, altogether, not more than 20 pictures.
2011-07-16 14:37:45	nadir	one question:
2011-07-16 14:37:55	nadir	instead of doing switcheroo,
2011-07-16 14:38:13	nadir	can't i open the file, compare it with my directory, save the result in an array,
2011-07-16 14:38:17	nadir	close the file.
2011-07-16 14:38:27	nadir	open it for writing, and thats it?
2011-07-16 14:38:36	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1086626
2011-07-16 14:38:54	fsmithred	that's not complete
2011-07-16 14:39:17	fsmithred	idea is to add lines, not replace
2011-07-16 14:39:27	fsmithred	and skip figuring out what's missing
2011-07-16 14:39:34	nadir	uhum.
2011-07-16 14:39:38	fsmithred	just add every pic in the directory
2011-07-16 14:39:44	nadir	yup, got you.
2011-07-16 14:39:55	nadir	i am open for any solution which works.
2011-07-16 14:40:08	fsmithred	dbb's gist shows how to add the header
2011-07-16 14:40:22	nadir	the actual one is simply the first thing which came to my mind.
2011-07-16 14:41:32	fsmithred	I'm still confused about something
2011-07-16 14:41:49	fsmithred	will the replacement get replaced once only, or once for every line?
2011-07-16 14:41:55	fsmithred	the way dbb has it
2011-07-16 14:43:04	nadir	me thinks once perl line, but as there is only one line with <!--placeholder--> ...
2011-07-16 14:48:05	dbb0	nadir: to answer your question, i wouldn't do that
2011-07-16 14:48:19	nadir	ok.
2011-07-16 14:48:27	dbb0	the whole script is going to execute in a few milliseconds 
2011-07-16 14:48:59	fsmithred	wouldn't do what?
2011-07-16 14:49:26	dbb0	fsmithred: open a file as read only, close it, and the open it for writing
2011-07-16 14:49:35	fsmithred	ah, ok
2011-07-16 14:49:49	fsmithred	does this look like it's getting closer? https://gist.github.com/1086634
2011-07-16 14:50:53	dbb0	what are $text1 and $text2 for
2011-07-16 14:51:06	fsmithred	header and footer of html file
2011-07-16 14:51:47	dbb0	so file.html is blank when the script starts?
2011-07-16 14:51:59	fsmithred	fuck
2011-07-16 14:52:25	fsmithred	I guess you would need to start with a blank file
2011-07-16 14:52:39	dbb0	you're opening it for reading at the beginning of the script.
2011-07-16 14:52:40	fsmithred	just create it new each time you run the script
2011-07-16 14:52:43	fsmithred	duh
2011-07-16 14:52:57	fsmithred	ok, so if you replace the placeholder...
2011-07-16 14:53:04	dbb0	and making a back up of it
2011-07-16 14:53:08	fsmithred	what happens to the placeholder after the first time yhou replace it?
2011-07-16 14:53:18	fsmithred	it's gone?
2011-07-16 14:53:31	dbb0	there's no substitution anywhere in this script
2011-07-16 14:53:36	fsmithred	I kjnow that
2011-07-16 14:53:44	fsmithred	I removed it, because I didn't understand it
2011-07-16 14:53:55	fsmithred	if you do it the other way, with substitution
2011-07-16 14:54:04	fsmithred	what happens after the first substitution?
2011-07-16 14:54:10	dbb0	then i can't tell you what the code will do without seeing it
2011-07-16 14:54:27	dbb0	unless you're talking about my example
2011-07-16 14:54:31	fsmithred	if you have more than one file to add, do you have to run the script every time for each one?
2011-07-16 14:54:35	fsmithred	yours or nadir's
2011-07-16 14:54:51	fsmithred	just the concept of substituting a placeholder with a href
2011-07-16 14:55:16	fsmithred	do you understand my question?
2011-07-16 14:55:23	dbb0	i think so
2011-07-16 14:55:31	@telemachus	hey all
2011-07-16 14:55:44	@telemachus	(what do I call the old switcheroo?)
2011-07-16 14:55:50	fsmithred	if it gets substituted, then it's no longer there to get substituted a second time, right?
2011-07-16 14:56:02	dbb0	so in the loop for ( @lines ) , each element is assigned to $_ in turn
2011-07-16 14:56:25	dbb0	the s// command changes the value of $_ 
2011-07-16 14:57:15	dbb0	but it's not permanent, because the next iteration will overwrite $_, and furthermore $_ has a different meaning outside the scope of the loop
2011-07-16 14:57:40	@telemachus	mk, I'm lost
2011-07-16 14:57:46	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-16 14:58:01	dbb0	which is why some people will use for my $var ( @ list ) 
2011-07-16 14:58:06	dbb0	it's clearer
2011-07-16 14:58:51	fsmithred	what my script attempts to do is what dilbert suggested in the forum thread  - just add all the pics to the html file
2011-07-16 14:59:05	dbb0	telemachus: the switcheroo is writing to a temperary file then copying the temporary file to the desired filename
2011-07-16 14:59:16	fsmithred	but I dont need to read an input file if I'm going to create the whole file anew each time
2011-07-16 14:59:17	@telemachus	ah, right, bingo
2011-07-16 14:59:18	dbb0	excuse the spelling
2011-07-16 14:59:27	@telemachus	the switch is the name-switching
2011-07-16 14:59:28	@telemachus	got it
2011-07-16 14:59:38	@telemachus	that's the safe way to edit a file "in-place"
2011-07-16 14:59:46	@telemachus	true in-place editing is almost always dangerous
2011-07-16 14:59:58	dbb0	telemachus: fsmithred was asking about a substituion example i gave
2011-07-16 15:00:04	@telemachus	gotcha
2011-07-16 15:00:07	@telemachus	(gist?)
2011-07-16 15:00:17	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1080666
2011-07-16 15:01:17	dbb0	telemachus: nadir asked about opening a file for reading, closing it (And storing some info as an array), then opening it back up for writing. i said that that didn't sound like a good idea
2011-07-16 15:01:36	@telemachus	agreed
2011-07-16 15:01:46	@telemachus	why would you want to read and write from the same file?
2011-07-16 15:02:03	dbb0	my concern was the small time window in which that would happen
2011-07-16 15:02:09	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-16 15:02:16	nadir	huh?
2011-07-16 15:02:43	@telemachus	huh huh?
2011-07-16 15:02:45	fsmithred	I think he means no time to say "oh shit"
2011-07-16 15:02:51	fsmithred	and stop it before it's too late
2011-07-16 15:03:04	dbb0	like running '<file.txt sed "s/foo/bar" >file.txt'
2011-07-16 15:03:15	@telemachus	always a mistake
2011-07-16 15:03:25	@telemachus	most unix tools declare the result as "undefined"
2011-07-16 15:03:33	@telemachus	if you  have one file for < and >
2011-07-16 15:03:45	@telemachus	the result is normally an empty buffer
2011-07-16 15:03:59	dbb0	you would think that the shell would "pause" in between "opening" and "closing" the file, but it really doesnt
2011-07-16 15:04:18	dbb0	and you end up with a bug uh-oh
2011-07-16 15:04:39	@telemachus	yeah, and there's always unflushed buffers - the timing of writes to disc is not immediate in general
2011-07-16 15:04:47	@telemachus	let me go back though
2011-07-16 15:04:56	@telemachus	What are we trying to accomplish?
2011-07-16 15:05:14	@telemachus	dilbert's approach was smart - fuck the diffing, just redo the whole thing every time
2011-07-16 15:05:26	dbb0	telemachus: basically, add links to pictures in an html file if they arent already there
2011-07-16 15:05:28	@telemachus	for anything short of 100,000 files, it's bound to be faster
2011-07-16 15:05:44	@telemachus	dbb0: Yeah, but I'm past the "if they aren't already there"
2011-07-16 15:05:50	@telemachus	just replace that whole section every time
2011-07-16 15:05:52	dbb0	lol
2011-07-16 15:05:56	@telemachus	quicker, simpler algorithm
2011-07-16 15:05:57	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1086634
2011-07-16 15:06:06	fsmithred	comment out the input file
2011-07-16 15:06:49	dbb0	fsmithred: you for got to close the other one
2011-07-16 15:07:23	fsmithred	close the out file?
2011-07-16 15:07:31	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-16 15:07:33	@telemachus	fsmithred: In that case, you don't need the tmp file, I don't think
2011-07-16 15:07:42	@telemachus	If line 13 succeeds, you already have a backup of it
2011-07-16 15:07:45	fsmithred	oh, right
2011-07-16 15:07:48	@telemachus	So just write directly to file.html
2011-07-16 15:08:06	fsmithred	ok, close outfile before I copy it?
2011-07-16 15:08:09	dbb0	fsmithred: also, with something like "$text1" the quotes are useless
2011-07-16 15:08:20	@telemachus	since, so far as I can see, you never use $in
2011-07-16 15:08:44	@telemachus	actually, worse that useless - can be harmful in some edge cases
2011-07-16 15:08:50	@telemachus	only quote if you are interpolating
2011-07-16 15:09:00	fsmithred	ok, thanks
2011-07-16 15:09:02	@telemachus	that is, adding a variable value into a string
2011-07-16 15:09:22	@telemachus	ditto on 38
2011-07-16 15:09:26	@telemachus	print $out $line;
2011-07-16 15:09:39	@telemachus	though that's a nice idiom to have mastered - indirect filehandle - nice!
2011-07-16 15:09:41	fsmithred	line has variables in it
2011-07-16 15:09:49	dbb0	perl knows that $out is a file and $line is a string
2011-07-16 15:09:55	@telemachus	fsmithred: Doesn't matter
2011-07-16 15:10:00	@telemachus	$line *is* a variable
2011-07-16 15:10:14	@telemachus	all the rest should be automagic
2011-07-16 15:10:29	@telemachus	unless it's like this: say "This is my $line. Do you like it?"
2011-07-16 15:10:44	@telemachus	that's interpolation: I've mixed a string and a variable
2011-07-16 15:10:52	@telemachus	oh, and 41
2011-07-16 15:10:58	@telemachus	print $out $text
2011-07-16 15:11:40	dbb0	$a='a'; $b=$a.$a; print $b # exactly the same as: print "$b"; #
2011-07-16 15:11:42	@telemachus	finally, let's use better variable names -> text1 should be header and text2 should be footer
2011-07-16 15:12:27	fsmithred	I think I do need the tmp file
2011-07-16 15:12:39	fsmithred	or I'll be appending the whole thing to the old file
2011-07-16 15:12:46	dbb0	not with >
2011-07-16 15:12:54	dbb0	instead of >>
2011-07-16 15:13:00	@telemachus	no, I'm saying this: open my $out, ">", "file.html"
2011-07-16 15:13:07	@telemachus	db beat me to it
2011-07-16 15:13:09	fsmithred	ok, and each $line will be appended in the loop?
2011-07-16 15:13:29	@telemachus	fsmithred: This is tricky at first a file is open for writing until you close it
2011-07-16 15:13:40	@telemachus	each write goes after the last
2011-07-16 15:13:45	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 15:13:46	@telemachus	and perl keeps track of the bytemark
2011-07-16 15:13:57	@telemachus	so it's not really "appending", but in practice, yeah
2011-07-16 15:14:10	@telemachus	until you close the file handle all successive writes go one after the other
2011-07-16 15:14:37	@telemachus	(in practice, actual *writing* doesn't happen until the buffer is full - the writes don't happen right away.)
2011-07-16 15:14:49	@telemachus	(but in normal circumstances, you'll never know the difference)
2011-07-16 15:14:56	@telemachus	(it will happen in the blink of an eye)
2011-07-16 15:15:38	@telemachus	fsmithred: by the way, wow - you use 8-space tabs, huh?
2011-07-16 15:15:47	@telemachus	old school
2011-07-16 15:15:48	@telemachus	I like
2011-07-16 15:15:51	fsmithred	no, those are 4
2011-07-16 15:16:12	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-16 15:16:19	@telemachus	then why is line 37 and 38 so far in?
2011-07-16 15:16:47	@telemachus	ok, off to shower - just back from workout
2011-07-16 15:16:48	@telemachus	brb
2011-07-16 15:16:55	fsmithred	I need to look at the gist you're looking at
2011-07-16 15:16:55	dbb0	telemachus: github's fault
2011-07-16 15:16:56	nadir	workout? wtf?
2011-07-16 15:17:20	dbb0	my tabs show up as 8 spaces too.
2011-07-16 15:17:21	fsmithred	yeah, github added that space
2011-07-16 15:17:37	fsmithred	in geany, it's only four spaces for a tab
2011-07-16 15:17:57	dbb0	there's a way to make vim convert your tabs to spaces, but i disabled it
2011-07-16 15:18:21	dbb0	well never mind then
2011-07-16 15:19:51	fsmithred	close $out;   (is that correct?)
2011-07-16 15:20:59	dbb0	did you look at the perlintro?
2011-07-16 15:21:07	fsmithred	not lately
2011-07-16 15:21:18	nadir	dbb0, yes.
2011-07-16 15:21:25	nadir	and more than once.
2011-07-16 15:21:39	dbb0	it tells you in the section i mentioned earlier
2011-07-16 15:22:38	dbb0	of course, it will be superfluous since you're using autodie
2011-07-16 15:23:53	dbb0	just remember that it only takes one argument, so you need a separate close statement for each file you open
2011-07-16 15:26:14	fsmithred	ok, thanks
2011-07-16 15:27:23	fsmithred	nadir, you want me to gist the corrected version?
2011-07-16 15:27:31	nadir	yup. very much.
2011-07-16 15:27:43	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1086665
2011-07-16 15:27:50	nadir	i got lost somewhere, and didn't follow all of your sayings.
2011-07-16 15:27:57	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 15:28:05	fsmithred	test it - I think it might actually work
2011-07-16 15:28:50	dbb0	you said "foreach my $pic  (@pictures) " but then you never used the variable $pic in the loop
2011-07-16 15:29:35	fsmithred	it's part of $line
2011-07-16 15:30:02	dbb0	ah, i see now
2011-07-16 15:30:13	fsmithred	I stole that code from nadir
2011-07-16 15:31:02	dbb0	i would rewrite it using double quotes in the html. i'm pretty sure that's standard
2011-07-16 15:31:13	fsmithred	and I don't understand what the html code is doing
2011-07-16 15:31:24	nadir	what it does is this:
2011-07-16 15:31:30	nadir	it points to a picture,
2011-07-16 15:31:50	nadir	instead of describing it: say-> me_naked_on_the_floor
2011-07-16 15:31:54	nadir	it uses a thumbnail
2011-07-16 15:32:03	nadir	so you don't see a describtion, but a thumbnail
2011-07-16 15:32:06	dbb0	my $line = "<a href=\"./gallery/pictures/$pic\"><img src=\"./gallery/thumbnails/$pic\" alt=\"Desciption\"></a>";
2011-07-16 15:33:17	nadir	if you go here:
2011-07-16 15:33:20	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/content/misc.content/gallery.html
2011-07-16 15:33:33	nadir	<img src=\"./gallery/thumbnails/$pic\" alt=\"Desciption\"
2011-07-16 15:33:41	nadir	is what you see there, as thumbnails.
2011-07-16 15:33:46	dbb0	my $line = '<a href="./gallery/pictures/' . $pic . '"><img src="./gallery/thumbnails/' . $pic . '" alt="Desciption"></a>';
2011-07-16 15:33:46	nadir	if you click on them, you go to:
2011-07-16 15:34:00	nadir	<a href=\"./gallery/pictures/$pic\"
2011-07-16 15:34:06	nadir	k?
2011-07-16 15:34:25	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-16 15:34:35	nadir	good.
2011-07-16 15:34:38	nadir	:-)
2011-07-16 15:34:38	fsmithred	so, you have a thumbnail and a full-size pic with the same name?
2011-07-16 15:34:42	@telemachus	nadir: You don't approve of my being in shape?
2011-07-16 15:34:50	nadir	ha.
2011-07-16 15:34:52	fsmithred	wtf?
2011-07-16 15:35:08	nadir	yes, i got two of the same name.
2011-07-16 15:35:15	fsmithred	ok, thanks
2011-07-16 15:35:17	nadir	the thumbnails are there for looking.
2011-07-16 15:35:25	nadir	short glance.
2011-07-16 15:35:38	nadir	full-size is for .... well: no clue. it seemed to make sense.
2011-07-16 15:35:40	@telemachus	My wife is all for it.
2011-07-16 15:35:44	@telemachus	So's my doctor.
2011-07-16 15:35:54	fsmithred	yeah, I get it
2011-07-16 15:36:02	fsmithred	um, about that tinfoil hat...
2011-07-16 15:36:07	fsmithred	I don't think it covers enough
2011-07-16 15:36:08	@telemachus	I know right?
2011-07-16 15:37:16	fsmithred	looks like stuff could get into parts of frontal, temporal and maybe occipital lobes
2011-07-16 15:37:32	 *	nadir is lost in several universes.
2011-07-16 15:37:44	@telemachus	nadir: Btw, I saw you complaining on the thread about the images in Apache-Gallery not being the same size. But we talked about that: they can't be unless the images are the same size. Otherwise - fun-house mirror effect.
2011-07-16 15:37:50	nadir	perl, workouts, doctors, wifes, tinfoil-hats...
2011-07-16 15:38:08	@telemachus	nadir: Keep up, dude
2011-07-16 15:38:15	@telemachus	I will drop git on your ass soon
2011-07-16 15:38:17	nadir	telemachus, yeah , but i think we talked about it afterwards, not sure though.
2011-07-16 15:38:24	@telemachus	nadir: Ah, k, cool
2011-07-16 15:38:35	nadir	and, as you know, i  complain out of habit.
2011-07-16 15:38:44	@telemachus	nadir: Yes, I know
2011-07-16 15:38:45	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-16 15:38:46	dbb0	i started on eloquent javascript yesterday
2011-07-16 15:38:47	nadir	:-)
2011-07-16 15:38:51	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-16 15:39:13	@telemachus	dbb0: It's a fun book in many ways. Some crazy examples. But I love the interactive console.
2011-07-16 15:39:38	dbb0	way cool
2011-07-16 15:39:57	nadir	fsmithred, would it be a choice for you to try to get that "picture-problem" solved?
2011-07-16 15:40:03	@telemachus	he's released an open-source library to put interactive editors on websites
2011-07-16 15:40:07	nadir	looks do-able, but still interesting... for me.
2011-07-16 15:40:36	fsmithred	which problem?
2011-07-16 15:40:55	nadir	holy cow. The problem of today. Adding the pics to html...
2011-07-16 15:41:18	fsmithred	I think all you need to do is put your header and footer in that script
2011-07-16 15:41:22	fsmithred	and run it
2011-07-16 15:41:23	dbb0	telemachus: however, i felt like "dive into html5" was mostly hot air
2011-07-16 15:41:27	@telemachus	dbb0: http://codemirror.net/
2011-07-16 15:41:32	fsmithred	and replace the filename
2011-07-16 15:41:32	nadir	not really.
2011-07-16 15:41:39	nadir	i got the pictures sorted.
2011-07-16 15:41:51	nadir	so i  would at least need an option to sort them.
2011-07-16 15:42:07	@telemachus	dbb0: Hmm, maybe the first chapter or so. This chapter is virtually all you need to get started: http://diveintohtml5.org/semantics.html
2011-07-16 15:42:16	fsmithred	sort(@pictures) ?
2011-07-16 15:42:20	nadir	i worked around it by keeping it "static", and adding new pics to new.
2011-07-16 15:42:22	@telemachus	He transforms an HTML 4 blog site to HTML 5
2011-07-16 15:42:26	nadir	look at the site:
2011-07-16 15:42:31	@telemachus	It's very good on the markup/semantic elements
2011-07-16 15:42:37	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/content/misc.content/gallery.html
2011-07-16 15:42:45	fsmithred	oh, you've got categories
2011-07-16 15:42:48	nadir	you got: "me", "screenshots", ...
2011-07-16 15:42:50	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-16 15:43:04	nadir	not that it would be that important, but i would like to keep it like that.
2011-07-16 15:43:05	fsmithred	so if a new picture shows up in the directory
2011-07-16 15:43:13	fsmithred	the script has to know what section it goes in
2011-07-16 15:43:19	@telemachus	one thought: create a fixed naming scheme for the pics
2011-07-16 15:43:28	fsmithred	yeah, that's what I was thinking
2011-07-16 15:43:28	@telemachus	all me pics are me_name.jpg
2011-07-16 15:43:32	@telemachus	that way you can glob by group
2011-07-16 15:43:37	nadir	telemachus, yup, somehow like that. some solution.
2011-07-16 15:43:41	@telemachus	my @me_pics = ...
2011-07-16 15:43:44		[dbb0 away: _]
2011-07-16 15:43:49	nadir	i don't say its super-hard, but i think its a nice project.
2011-07-16 15:43:52	@telemachus	Would work pretty well
2011-07-16 15:43:56	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-16 15:44:00	fsmithred	and then a loop for each category
2011-07-16 15:44:01	nadir	uhum.
2011-07-16 15:44:12	nadir	i could also put them in sub-dirs per se.
2011-07-16 15:44:18	fsmithred	with the title words between the loops
2011-07-16 15:44:19	@telemachus	fsmithred: Right and multiple placeholders I guess
2011-07-16 15:44:26	@telemachus	fsmithred: Bingo - beat me to it
2011-07-16 15:44:48	nadir	if you, fsmithred , like, we can try to get it sorted. But we don't have to.
2011-07-16 15:44:59	@telemachus	Look at the bad-ass Linux guy: http://resident.dyndns.info/images/gallery/pictures/compiz-cube.png
2011-07-16 15:45:02	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-16 15:45:03	nadir	i think for both of us its a good level of perl
2011-07-16 15:45:22	@telemachus	hey antinoos is in that shot! he's famous
2011-07-16 15:45:44	nadir	ha ha ha.
2011-07-16 15:45:45	fsmithred	that's not a cube - it's a cylinder
2011-07-16 15:45:49	@telemachus	!tr en de Does this still work or did Google dump this shit?
2011-07-16 15:45:49	@antinoos	Bedeutet dies noch funktionieren oder hat Google Dump diese Scheiße?
2011-07-16 15:45:59	@telemachus	Heh - still works
2011-07-16 15:46:10	nadir	i use it quite often, and it does work (usually)
2011-07-16 15:46:17	@telemachus	though Dump shouldn't be a noun there
2011-07-16 15:46:21	@telemachus	bad translator, bad
2011-07-16 15:46:46	@telemachus	nadir: And you and Louking can share screenies now.
2011-07-16 15:46:47	fsmithred	my @me_pictures = glob("me*.png me*.jpg");
2011-07-16 15:46:59	@telemachus	fsmithred: yup, not too bad, right?
2011-07-16 15:47:05	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-16 15:47:08	fsmithred	question
2011-07-16 15:47:17	@telemachus	the hard part is the discipline to (1) fix the names now and (2) keep them right as you add new ones
2011-07-16 15:47:20	nadir	what? lou_the_king_posting_in_every_fucking_forum?
2011-07-16 15:47:25	fsmithred	foreach my $pic (@me_pictures)
2011-07-16 15:47:30	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-16 15:47:33	fsmithred	can $pic be the same for each loop?
2011-07-16 15:47:46	fsmithred	or will perl complain that I'm re-using a variable?
2011-07-16 15:47:55	nadir	what i would also need is to add a checker: is there also a thumbnail.
2011-07-16 15:48:00	nadir	and similar stuff.
2011-07-16 15:48:01	@telemachus	fsmithred: $pic is aliased to each item in @me_pictures, one at a time
2011-07-16 15:48:03	@telemachus	oh, wait
2011-07-16 15:48:06	@telemachus	diff question
2011-07-16 15:48:18	@telemachus	yes, you can reuse loop vars with my, no problem
2011-07-16 15:48:24	fsmithred	cool, thanks
2011-07-16 15:48:28	nadir	if not: run a tool to create a thumbnail.
2011-07-16 15:48:36	fsmithred	holy shit, nadir
2011-07-16 15:48:39	nadir	so: if we want we can work for it.
2011-07-16 15:48:42	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 15:48:45	fsmithred	sounds good
2011-07-16 15:48:45	nadir	we don't have to, but we can.
2011-07-16 15:48:58	fsmithred	so we need to learn how to run external programs
2011-07-16 15:49:03	fsmithred	haven't covered that yet
2011-07-16 15:49:15	nadir	creating a web-site and the directories is easy. No need for much stuff.
2011-07-16 15:49:17	fsmithred	or did we?
2011-07-16 15:49:23	nadir	not that i would know.
2011-07-16 15:49:24	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/1086694
2011-07-16 15:49:28	nadir	something with system, i assume.
2011-07-16 15:49:51	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-16 15:49:57	@telemachus	system is one way
2011-07-16 15:50:18	nadir	and the tool is magic-whatever.
2011-07-16 15:50:21	fsmithred	imagemagik to resize the pic?
2011-07-16 15:50:21	@telemachus	exec is another
2011-07-16 15:50:24	nadir	ah: imagemagic
2011-07-16 15:50:24	fsmithred	you know the command?
2011-07-16 15:50:36	nadir	canci once made a script.
2011-07-16 15:50:44	fsmithred	yeah, I remember that
2011-07-16 15:50:55	fsmithred	it's in the thunar custom actions thread
2011-07-16 15:50:56	@telemachus	nadir: The full size of fubar.jpg is TOOOOOOOOO freakin' big
2011-07-16 15:51:01	nadir	either we extract it, or we ask him (i already told him bout the problem, and that i might need his help)
2011-07-16 15:51:10	nadir	telemachus, i did not know.

2011-07-16 15:51:45	fsmithred	huh?

2011-07-16 15:51:50	nadir	ah, i see.
2011-07-16 15:51:59	nadir	thanks. will try to keep it in mind.
2011-07-16 15:52:02	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-16 15:52:25	@telemachus	in general, no image online should be wider than 800 or 900 pixels
2011-07-16 15:52:34	nadir	yup. like that.
2011-07-16 15:52:41	@telemachus	that thing is 2976
2011-07-16 15:52:43	@telemachus	across
2011-07-16 15:52:45	nadir	i really don't deal much with pictures.
2011-07-16 15:52:48	@telemachus	and 2232 up and down
2011-07-16 15:52:51	nadir	i barely use them.
2011-07-16 15:53:09	fsmithred	and with that resolution, we should be able to clearly see the pores in your skin and individual hairs
2011-07-16 15:53:27	@telemachus	it'sactually, mr_punkrock is pretty big too
2011-07-16 15:53:37	@telemachus	but I like that pic better for some reason
2011-07-16 15:53:38	nadir	yup, of the same camera.
2011-07-16 15:53:42	@telemachus	foobar looks angrier
2011-07-16 15:53:45	nadir	i likeit too.
2011-07-16 15:53:56	@telemachus	punk_rock is kind of smiling at least
2011-07-16 15:54:03	@telemachus	smirky smile
2011-07-16 15:54:34	@telemachus	this one should be called "Lulzsec captured!" http://resident.dyndns.info/images/gallery/pictures/wplace1.jpg

2011-07-16 15:56:55	nadir	what?
2011-07-16 15:56:57	fsmithred	we started with bash last july

2011-07-16 15:57:02	nadir	holy maria.
2011-07-16 15:57:02	fsmithred	not sure what day
2011-07-16 15:57:10	nadir	feels much longer.
2011-07-16 15:57:17	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-16 15:57:34	nadir	i often feel very bad when it comes to programming.
2011-07-16 15:57:41	nadir	its very hard for me.
2011-07-16 15:57:43	fsmithred	I need to make a sandwich
2011-07-16 15:57:47	nadir	i got the feeling i get nowhere.
2011-07-16 15:57:58	fsmithred	you know a lot more than you did a year ago
2011-07-16 15:58:03	nadir	PC/computing is ok, but programming: holy shit.
2011-07-16 15:58:04	fsmithred	I"m sure of that
2011-07-16 15:58:19	fsmithred	anyway, I need a 5 min. break
2011-07-16 15:58:22	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-16 15:58:24	nadir	uhum. thanks for ... mhhhh... heads up(?).
2011-07-16 15:58:28	nadir	k, take your time.
2011-07-16 15:58:52	nadir	telemachus, any idea why i get "nil" if i use gist?

2011-07-16 16:04:14	nadir	no.
2011-07-16 16:04:15	@telemachus	ruby is installed, nothing else changed?
2011-07-16 16:04:19	@telemachus	ah, that's probably it
2011-07-16 16:04:30	nadir	ruby is not installed. i have chosen the old-school-installing
2011-07-16 16:04:38	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-16 16:04:41	nadir	wget it, and thats it.
2011-07-16 16:04:49	@telemachus	is git fuly configured?
2011-07-16 16:04:58	nadir	wait a sec.
2011-07-16 16:05:04	@telemachus	if you run "git config --list"
2011-07-16 16:05:04	nadir	i changed the email for git.
2011-07-16 16:05:09	nadir	today.
2011-07-16 16:05:17	@telemachus	do you see github.user and github.token?
2011-07-16 16:05:28	nadir	yes.
2011-07-16 16:05:42	@telemachus	but you canged the email for git to something different than the github.user email?
2011-07-16 16:05:45	@telemachus	that could be it
2011-07-16 16:06:19	nadir	ah, mhh... that might be.
2011-07-16 16:06:32	nadir	i got a new email, at riseup, and change one at a time.
2011-07-16 16:06:40	nadir	lets try what i got at github.
2011-07-16 16:09:33	nadir	holy fuck. iceweasel5 is pretty borked.
2011-07-16 16:10:59	nadir	mhh.. i added the new email to github, still "nil". I got to look at that later (the emails)
2011-07-16 16:11:05	nadir	thats probably the problem
2011-07-16 16:11:23	fsmithred	back
2011-07-16 16:11:41	nadir	ah. good.
2011-07-16 16:14:06	@telemachus	wb
2011-07-16 16:16:42	fsmithred	thanks
2011-07-16 16:16:55	fsmithred	ok, separate loops for separate categories
2011-07-16 16:17:05	fsmithred	check for thumbnail and create one if needed
2011-07-16 16:17:08	fsmithred	anything else?
2011-07-16 16:17:50	fsmithred	would you rather rename all your pics, or make a subdirectory for each category?>
2011-07-16 16:18:40	nadir	i guess i would rather make sub-dirs.
2011-07-16 16:18:53	nadir	to keep it more clean, not to avoid renaming.

2011-07-16 16:36:35	fsmithred	anyone here?
2011-07-16 16:36:38	fsmithred	nadir!
2011-07-16 16:36:41	nadir	yeah,
2011-07-16 16:36:43	nadir	sorry,
2011-07-16 16:36:44	fsmithred	hi
2011-07-16 16:36:52	fsmithred	I got disconnected
2011-07-16 16:36:57	fsmithred	how to use chdir?
2011-07-16 16:36:58	nadir	lots of things goind down, plus the perl-fucking earlier, i am a bit out of order.
2011-07-16 16:37:04	nadir	its easy, wait.
2011-07-16 16:37:13	nadir	well: chdir (/path/to)
2011-07-16 16:37:15	fsmithred	what punctuation to use on the path
2011-07-16 16:37:16	nadir	i think
2011-07-16 16:37:17	fsmithred	ok, parens
2011-07-16 16:37:33	nadir	let me compare with my script (i would not bet its right)
2011-07-16 16:38:16	nadir	i ain't got parens, and i think it worked too.
2011-07-16 16:38:45	nadir	as far i can tell best is to first use:
2011-07-16 16:38:49	nadir	use Cwd;
2011-07-16 16:38:57	nadir	my $cur_dir = getcwd();
2011-07-16 16:39:08	nadir	so you can easily go back to where you came from.
2011-07-16 16:39:27	fsmithred	I don't think we need to go back there
2011-07-16 16:39:42	fsmithred	or are you keeping the script in the same dir as gallery.html?
2011-07-16 16:39:49	nadir	well: not really. no clue why i wantedto.
2011-07-16 16:40:11	nadir	mhh... i ain't got it in the same dir like gallery.html
2011-07-16 16:40:13	fsmithred	just need to get to where the relative paths make sense
2011-07-16 16:40:17	nadir	i got one dir: gallery.
2011-07-16 16:40:26	nadir	inside of that is pictures and thumbnails.
2011-07-16 16:40:30	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 16:40:41	fsmithred	so we change it to gallery/pictures/me
2011-07-16 16:40:41	nadir	i think there is where i would want addpics.pl to be.
2011-07-16 16:40:44	fsmithred	etc
2011-07-16 16:40:52	nadir	sounds good.
2011-07-16 16:41:04	fsmithred	I think the script should be somewhere else
2011-07-16 16:41:19	fsmithred	but not sure what most people do with stuff like that
2011-07-16 16:41:34	fsmithred	somewhere in your path
2011-07-16 16:41:46	fsmithred	$HOME/bin maybe
2011-07-16 16:42:07	nadir	if you want to play with it: put the whole shebang in one dir: pictures/thumbnails/addpics.pl/index.html
2011-07-16 16:42:18	nadir	that is the most easy way, i think
2011-07-16 16:42:34	nadir	chaning paths later is not that hard, i think
2011-07-16 16:42:46	nadir	well: bin would be fine too.
2011-07-16 16:43:04	dbb0	perl -le 'print $ENV{PWD}'
2011-07-16 16:43:18	dbb0	the %ENV hash is very useful
2011-07-16 16:43:20	nadir	oh. well. yes.
2011-07-16 16:43:31	nadir	print $ENV{USER} :-)
2011-07-16 16:44:22	fsmithred	um, I replaced single quotes with double, and my syntax highlighting is screwed up
2011-07-16 16:44:56	dbb0	single quotes -> zero interpolation or escaping
2011-07-16 16:45:02		[dbb0 back: gone 01:01:18]
2011-07-16 16:45:07	fsmithred	yeah, I know
2011-07-16 16:45:10	fsmithred	but...
2011-07-16 16:45:30	nadir	fsmithred, you got an easy way to resize pictures? else i can gist cancis_image_resizer.
2011-07-16 16:45:41	fsmithred	check canci's script
2011-07-16 16:45:43	fsmithred	I don't know how
2011-07-16 16:45:49	fsmithred	I always do it manually in gimp
2011-07-16 16:45:54	dbb0	nadir: use convert from imagemagick
2011-07-16 16:45:59	nadir	ah, well: gimp is probably cool too.
2011-07-16 16:46:09	nadir	dbb0, i think that is what canci did.
2011-07-16 16:46:23	nadir	just a few commands in a script, i did never look that close.
2011-07-16 16:46:44	nadir	instead of opening gimp and all, i simply run it and add the pictures as arguments.
2011-07-16 16:47:11	nadir	mhhhh.... you got the exact syntax for imagemagick and convert at hand?
2011-07-16 16:47:19	dbb0	http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php
2011-07-16 16:47:43	dbb0	with -resize you can use a percentage or exact pixels
2011-07-16 16:48:10	nadir	i usually do -> 145x145, i guess thats pixels (?)
2011-07-16 16:48:28	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-16 16:48:43	nadir	oh, that, what you linked, looks do-able, even for me.
2011-07-16 16:49:42	fsmithred	so is the screwed up highlighting a warning that something is wrong, or should I ignore it?
2011-07-16 16:49:54	dbb0	fsmithred: let me see the code
2011-07-16 16:49:56	fsmithred	even number of double quotes, but it doesn't come out right
2011-07-16 16:50:19	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1086776
2011-07-16 16:51:03	dbb0	yeah, that's really screwed up
2011-07-16 16:51:21	fsmithred	all I did was find and replace all ' with "
2011-07-16 16:51:30	dbb0	yep
2011-07-16 16:51:56	dbb0	you need to escape the double quotes that are part of the string, like i did.
2011-07-16 16:52:25	fsmithred	from <a href to </a> ?
2011-07-16 16:52:45	dbb0	my $line = "<a href=\"./gallery/pictures/$pic\"><img src=\"./gallery/thumbnails/$pic\"alt=\"Desciption\"></a>";
2011-07-16 16:52:53	fsmithred	all the ones that are part of the html code
2011-07-16 16:52:57	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 16:53:08	dbb0	i prefered the version with the catenate operator personally
2011-07-16 16:53:19	fsmithred	huh?
2011-07-16 16:53:29	@telemachus	Have any of you been following this? http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=62493&start=150
2011-07-16 16:53:35	@telemachus	I don't know whether to laugh or cry

2011-07-16 16:54:21	nadir	"are you sure you run Debian?"
2011-07-16 16:54:31	@telemachus	nadir: ?
2011-07-16 16:54:56	nadir	well: its an old quote, to someone who is kinda crazy with his questions.
2011-07-16 16:55:05	@telemachus	ah, gotcha
2011-07-16 16:55:10	@telemachus	Those two are nuts
2011-07-16 16:55:16	nadir	a bit much of association.
2011-07-16 16:55:38	@telemachus	basicaly pcalvert gives ron three commands per post, then rod/ron runs them and something explodes, then they start over
2011-07-16 16:55:44	fsmithred	dbb0, I'm lost with those quotes
2011-07-16 16:55:46	nadir	i barely followed the thread. When i realized it it was already at page 4 or 5, so i assumed it pointless
2011-07-16 16:56:03	@telemachus	yeah, but it's a train wreck I can't stop looking at
2011-07-16 16:56:06	nadir	mhhh... i think pcalvert is rather a good helper, no?
2011-07-16 16:56:07	@telemachus	they just keep going
2011-07-16 16:56:09	fsmithred	I think I read that thread awhile ago
2011-07-16 16:56:18	@telemachus	he's been fixing that computer for over a month
2011-07-16 16:56:24	nadir	yeah, its there for quite a while now.
2011-07-16 16:56:24	@telemachus	he just keeps going
2011-07-16 16:56:26	@telemachus	jesus
2011-07-16 16:57:12	@telemachus	2011-04-05 - 2011-07-16
2011-07-16 16:57:20	@telemachus	over three months
2011-07-16 16:57:22	@telemachus	actually
2011-07-16 16:57:24	@telemachus	mother fuck
2011-07-16 16:57:31	fsmithred	yeah, I remember reading it
2011-07-16 16:57:39	nadir	and all the time pcalvert is the one who is helping?
2011-07-16 16:57:44	dbb0	fsmithred: this might help http://i.imgur.com/P1MSQ.png
2011-07-16 16:57:49	@telemachus	nadir: pretty much everyone else gave up long ago
2011-07-16 16:57:57	nadir	now that i call patience.
2011-07-16 16:58:29	dbb0	(thanks to perltidy)
2011-07-16 16:58:31	nadir	i had that strange thread with my router, also about 12 pages,
2011-07-16 16:58:35	@telemachus	since page 2 bottom on 4-17
2011-07-16 16:58:39	@telemachus	he's the only one left
2011-07-16 16:58:46	@telemachus	so for three months, he's it
2011-07-16 16:58:52	nadir	much of a mess. Finally i simply needed a differetn web-browser for the web-interface (-> opera)
2011-07-16 16:59:04	@telemachus	bugsbunny tried a little at first, he quit soon
2011-07-16 16:59:07	@telemachus	wow
2011-07-16 16:59:15	nadir	hence it would not be fair if i would make fun of it...
2011-07-16 16:59:32	@telemachus	nadir: I'll make fun of it for you
2011-07-16 16:59:34	@telemachus	no problem
2011-07-16 16:59:36	nadir	ok.
2011-07-16 16:59:38	nadir	have at it.
2011-07-16 16:59:52	nadir	telemachus, bout my gist.
2011-07-16 16:59:53	fsmithred	dbb0, I guess it looks better that way, but I don't really understand the quoting
2011-07-16 17:00:07	nadir	if it was a problem with my git setup, git would be borked too, no?
2011-07-16 17:00:12	fsmithred	which ones are there for perl and which are there for html?
2011-07-16 17:00:15	nadir	i can use git, i can't use gist.
2011-07-16 17:00:17	@telemachus	nadir: no, not necessariy
2011-07-16 17:00:22	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-16 17:00:24	@telemachus	git would just record different emails
2011-07-16 17:00:31	@telemachus	but gist needs to be properly aligned with github
2011-07-16 17:00:38	@telemachus	try opening a browser and logging into github
2011-07-16 17:00:41	@telemachus	see if that helps
2011-07-16 17:00:42	nadir	no, git with github.
2011-07-16 17:00:48	dbb0	fsmithred: the . (catenate) operator is the key. it joins multiple strings together, so $line ends up as one string
2011-07-16 17:00:50	nadir	i did that, i will do it again.
2011-07-16 17:00:59	@telemachus	ah, hmm
2011-07-16 17:01:04	@telemachus	and you changed emails?
2011-07-16 17:01:20	@telemachus	there is a newer version of gist too - maybe wget and install that one?
2011-07-16 17:01:30	@telemachus	I have 2.0.3
2011-07-16 17:01:35	nadir	yes, i left the email i always use, and added the new one.
2011-07-16 17:01:42	fsmithred	looks like everything outside of $pic gets single quotes
2011-07-16 17:01:45	nadir	uhum. might try that.
2011-07-16 17:01:46	fsmithred	is that correct?
2011-07-16 17:01:48	dbb0	fsmithred: when your string has double quotes in it, you either have to single quote it, or double quote it and escape the double quotes that you want in the string
2011-07-16 17:02:15	dbb0	fsmithred: those parts are in single quotes because there is nothing to be interpolated.
2011-07-16 17:02:29	dbb0	they are meant literally
2011-07-16 17:02:33	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 17:02:42	fsmithred	but I don't know what quotes I want in the string
2011-07-16 17:02:54	fsmithred	I think I would need to understand a little more about html code to know that
2011-07-16 17:03:34	@telemachus	you can use single or double in HTML but double are more common
2011-07-16 17:03:53	dbb0	fsmithred: you want
2011-07-16 17:03:55	dbb0	<a href="./gallery/pictures/PIC"><img src="./gallery/thumbnails/PIC"alt="Desciption"></a>
2011-07-16 17:03:59	@telemachus	that is <a href='https://www.google.com'>Google</a> is valid
2011-07-16 17:04:16	fsmithred	ok, I just escaped all the quotes in the href, and the highlighting is better
2011-07-16 17:04:22	@telemachus	missing space there
2011-07-16 17:04:29	@telemachus	PIC" alt="...
2011-07-16 17:04:38	dbb0	in other words, all the double quotes that i escaped \" are the ones that stay.
2011-07-16 17:05:16	dbb0	yeah, typo
2011-07-16 17:05:33	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-16 17:07:52	fsmithred	yeah, I can understand that
2011-07-16 17:08:40	dbb0	it would look 10x worse in a shell script because there is no catenate operator. you just shove strings next to each other and it's a nightmare
2011-07-16 17:11:53	dbb0	well, the shells i use anyway.
2011-07-16 17:13:52	dbb0	nadir's and fsmithred's messages all show up as the same color in weechat, and i can't figure out why
2011-07-16 17:14:12	fsmithred	we should be different colors?
2011-07-16 17:14:49	@telemachus	depends on your client's configuration
2011-07-16 17:15:11	@telemachus	for me all other people are white and I'm gray
2011-07-16 17:15:13	@telemachus	http://cl.ly/8VQi
2011-07-16 17:15:23	@telemachus	also if someone highlights me, that's yellow I think
2011-07-16 17:15:43	dbb0	in a larger room like #debian or #perl colors are infrequently reused.
2011-07-16 17:17:12	dbb0	but in here there are only 5 users and already a color is used twice
2011-07-16 17:17:38	fsmithred	because nadir and I are buddies
2011-07-16 17:17:48	nadir	ha, i had the same thought.
2011-07-16 17:18:00	nadir	but for me, xchat, all got the same color.
2011-07-16 17:18:03	nadir	which is blue.
2011-07-16 17:18:27	nadir	only if someone mentions my name he gets a different color (which is red)
2011-07-16 17:19:17	fsmithred	same here
2011-07-16 17:19:36	fsmithred	could the color be dependent on which client we're using?
2011-07-16 17:19:47	fsmithred	I'm using xchat, too
2011-07-16 17:22:48	dbb0	do you have any other clients
2011-07-16 17:23:09	nadir	irssi and today i installed lostirc.
2011-07-16 17:24:38	fsmithred	how do I get here in irssi?
2011-07-16 17:24:51	nadir	. /server irc.freenode.net
2011-07-16 17:24:52	fsmithred	irssi -c freenode.net -n phred refused to connect
2011-07-16 17:25:02	fsmithred	irc.freenode.net
2011-07-16 17:25:02	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 17:25:05	nadir	. /join #sutdy-group
2011-07-16 17:25:11	nadir	without the typos.
2011-07-16 17:26:05	dbb0	i think the color might just be randomly chosen per nick
2011-07-16 17:26:24	dbb0	so if you log in with a different nick we won't know
2011-07-16 17:26:26	↔	nadir is now known as dingeldong

2011-07-16 17:26:38	phredxmidt	that was not easy
2011-07-16 17:26:41	phredxmidt	but I'm here
2011-07-16 17:26:46	phredxmidt	what color am I now?
2011-07-16 17:27:30	dbb0	dingeldong: changed from cyan to purple
2011-07-16 17:27:42	phredxmidt	ok, that was just a nick change
2011-07-16 17:27:42	dbb0	LOL
2011-07-16 17:27:45	dingeldong	ah, so your assumption has been right?
2011-07-16 17:27:51	phredxmidt	and I logged in with a different client
2011-07-16 17:27:56	dbb0	phredxmidt is the same color as dingeldong 
2011-07-16 17:28:01	phredxmidt	wow
2011-07-16 17:28:02	dbb0	both purple

2011-07-16 17:28:07	dingeldong	damn, we must be very good buddies.
2011-07-16 17:28:09	dbb0	nadir and fsmithred were cyan
2011-07-16 17:28:09	dingeldong	:-)
2011-07-16 17:28:32	dingeldong	once we started with C ...
2011-07-16 17:28:50	fsmithred	huh?
2011-07-16 17:29:08	dingeldong	mhh.. we now did a bit of bash and a bit of perl.
2011-07-16 17:29:11	@telemachus	dingeldong?
2011-07-16 17:29:12	dingeldong	we are of the same color.
2011-07-16 17:29:14	@telemachus	seriously
2011-07-16 17:29:18	fsmithred	I never did any C
2011-07-16 17:29:34	dingeldong	once we start using C, no one will be able to distinguish us anymore.
2011-07-16 17:29:37	dingeldong	it was a joke.

2011-07-16 17:29:51	@telemachus	but funny choice
2011-07-16 17:30:21	nadir	is "dingdong" an English word?
2011-07-16 17:30:25	fsmithred	these paths are killing me
2011-07-16 17:30:34	nadir	the html?
2011-07-16 17:30:34	dbb0	nadir: means schwanz
2011-07-16 17:30:37	nadir	oh.
2011-07-16 17:30:52	fsmithred	if I use the full path on the outfile, I can change directory as much as I want, and it'll still know where the outfile is, right?
2011-07-16 17:30:53	nadir	i did not know a word for schwanz, so i picked dingeldong.
2011-07-16 17:30:55	@telemachus	I thought he knew that
2011-07-16 17:30:55	nadir	funny.
2011-07-16 17:30:56	@telemachus	he knew that
2011-07-16 17:31:04	@telemachus	dong = dick
2011-07-16 17:31:12	nadir	no, in german i say -> mein Ding
2011-07-16 17:31:16	nadir	which is: my thing
2011-07-16 17:31:23	nadir	but i thougth saying: -> my thing
2011-07-16 17:31:31	nadir	no one would get it. so i said: dingdong.
2011-07-16 17:31:34	nadir	welll...
2011-07-16 17:31:38	@telemachus	in brookly we say, "I got your thing right here" (while grabbing our crotches...)
2011-07-16 17:31:42	dbb0	does unser ding refer to the mafia
2011-07-16 17:31:55	@telemachus	dbb0: In english or german?
2011-07-16 17:32:01	fsmithred	and dong generally means a big thing
2011-07-16 17:32:04	nadir	ah, no.
2011-07-16 17:32:14	dbb0	telemachus: its a translation of cosa nostra
2011-07-16 17:32:15	fsmithred	"thing"
2011-07-16 17:32:22	nadir	Its the same like English: "its not my thing"
2011-07-16 17:32:22	@telemachus	fsmithred: ? dingle -> little, dong => big?
2011-07-16 17:32:23	@telemachus	funny
2011-07-16 17:32:29	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-16 17:32:44	nadir	unser Ding -> our thing. our project. where our heart is at.
2011-07-16 17:33:03	nadir	if that is right i need to say: dongdong.

2011-07-16 17:43:33	@telemachus	oh

2011-07-16 17:44:35	nadir	for real?
2011-07-16 17:44:40	@telemachus	For real.
2011-07-16 17:44:48	nadir	Debian Gnu/kfreeBSD
2011-07-16 17:45:02	@telemachus	is that the lovechild of kde bsd and freedom?
2011-07-16 17:45:03	nadir	hence -> Debian Gnu/Linux sounds a bit different.
2011-07-16 17:45:14	nadir	well: that i don't know.
2011-07-16 17:45:14	@telemachus	my face fucking hurts
2011-07-16 17:45:24	nadir	no, k like Kernel
2011-07-16 17:45:31	@telemachus	so it's the gnu toolkit with a bsd kernel?
2011-07-16 17:45:35	@telemachus	right, I'm just getting it
2011-07-16 17:45:36	@telemachus	wow
2011-07-16 17:45:38	nadir	as far i know: yes.
2011-07-16 17:45:48	nadir	and Debian Gnu/Hurd seems ot have a run too.
2011-07-16 17:45:51	@telemachus	that _does_ sound like a mistake to me, lol
2011-07-16 17:46:07	 *	telemachus hides from dongalongdong
2011-07-16 17:46:12	nadir	well: if someone say: telemachus says "mistak" it makes sense.
2011-07-16 17:46:26	nadir	if someone says Lennart says :" mistake" i think "huh?"
2011-07-16 17:46:44	@telemachus	sure - though nobody cares about me double as much (little) as they care about Lennart
2011-07-16 17:46:53	nadir	and that is why i askes: "who is Lennart"
2011-07-16 17:46:54	@telemachus	Is Lennart European for Leonard?
2011-07-16 17:47:00	@telemachus	Why can't those people spell?
2011-07-16 17:47:06	@telemachus	The Europeans that is
2011-07-16 17:47:34	dbb0	auslautverhaertung

2011-07-16 17:47:47	@antinoos	devoicing
2011-07-16 17:47:53	nadir	i know "verhaertung", but that sure is not what you mean.
2011-07-16 17:47:56	@telemachus	ah, right
2011-07-16 17:47:59	@telemachus	linguistics
2011-07-16 17:48:16	@telemachus	I was hoping for a less technical answer, but fair enough :)
2011-07-16 17:48:20	fsmithred	nadir, I just emailed you a file
2011-07-16 17:48:27	nadir	ah, thanks.
2011-07-16 17:48:34	dbb0	voiced consonants at the end of the word are devoiced
2011-07-16 17:48:53	dbb0	but lennart is swedish so i dont think that applies
2011-07-16 17:49:06	@telemachus	Swedish is like European, right?
2011-07-16 17:49:32	dbb0	no. it's worse.
2011-07-16 17:49:46	@telemachus	But they have those nice berries.
2011-07-16 17:49:57	@telemachus	Them and the Norway people
2011-07-16 17:50:04	@telemachus	I like those berries.
2011-07-16 17:50:17	dbb0	they don't have anything but snow and universal healthcare
2011-07-16 17:50:19	@telemachus	Or is that Switzerland? Like most Americans, I'm never sure which is which.
2011-07-16 17:50:32	@telemachus	Lingonberries? mmmm
2011-07-16 17:52:23	nadir	mhh.. fsmithred.. at first glance it looks good. Let me try it tomorrow (after i slept)
2011-07-16 17:52:50	nadir	you can also post it in the thread, if you like.
2011-07-16 17:53:04	nadir	kind of an answer to dilberts_left_nut.
2011-07-16 17:53:20	fsmithred	it needs work
2011-07-16 17:53:23	fsmithred	check the paths
2011-07-16 17:53:42	nadir	yeah, i got you. i am too tired now (and today a lot went south...)
2011-07-16 17:53:48	fsmithred	I think you should use the full path on open(my $out...
2011-07-16 17:55:06	fsmithred	maybe I'll post version 2
2011-07-16 17:55:15	fsmithred	the one with all pics in the same directory
2011-07-16 17:55:19	nadir	you are fast. i admit that.
2011-07-16 17:55:27	fsmithred	um
2011-07-16 17:55:32	fsmithred	that took me a couple hours
2011-07-16 17:55:35	fsmithred	with help
2011-07-16 17:55:55	fsmithred	feels slow to me
2011-07-16 17:56:11	fsmithred	maybe I should be running arch instead of debian
2011-07-16 17:56:22	@telemachus	zoom zoom
2011-07-16 17:56:22	nadir	ah. yes. arsch.
2011-07-16 17:56:26	nadir	a great OS
2011-07-16 17:57:03	nadir	oh, you also added a placeholder for missing thumbnails.
2011-07-16 17:57:13	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-16 17:57:32	fsmithred	that's what the if ( -f $pic) was about
2011-07-16 17:57:44	fsmithred	else - do imagemagik magic
2011-07-16 17:57:54	nadir	ah, ok. at a certain point i stopped listening (as i was too tired)
2011-07-16 17:57:57	fsmithred	which I don't know how to do yet
2011-07-16 17:58:23	fsmithred	telemachus, what's the diff between exec and system?
2011-07-16 17:58:28	fsmithred	in 25 words or less
2011-07-16 17:58:38	fsmithred	10 or less even better
2011-07-16 17:58:53	@telemachus	exec doesn't return
2011-07-16 17:58:56	@telemachus	system returns
2011-07-16 17:59:27	nadir	i think "convert -size 145x145 image.png" should suffice (thats what the link says). let me test
2011-07-16 17:59:29	@telemachus	exec("cat foobar"); say "Won't get here, cause exec never returns...";
2011-07-16 18:00:23	dbb0	nadir: you need an input file and output file, i think
2011-07-16 18:00:37	nadir	yes, my test just showed me. damn.
2011-07-16 18:00:40	@telemachus	fsmithred: Does that make any sense?
2011-07-16 18:00:43	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-16 18:00:46	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-16 18:00:49	fsmithred	I don't think we need a return
2011-07-16 18:01:00	@telemachus	Do you have any lines below exec?
2011-07-16 18:01:09	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-16 18:01:14	@telemachus	then you need a return
2011-07-16 18:01:19	@telemachus	not return = your program is over
2011-07-16 18:01:22	fsmithred	after executing the convert command
2011-07-16 18:01:24	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 18:01:43	fsmithred	would need to add the line to the gallery.html that adds the picture and thumbnail
2011-07-16 18:02:04	fsmithred	ok, makes sense
2011-07-16 18:02:16	fsmithred	if convert completes properly, can move on
2011-07-16 18:02:25	fsmithred	otherwise, something else needs to happen
2011-07-16 18:02:33	fsmithred	like an error message
2011-07-16 18:03:38	@telemachus	fsmithred: https://gist.github.com/1086853
2011-07-16 18:04:17	fsmithred	so...
2011-07-16 18:04:33	fsmithred	system(convert $pic);
2011-07-16 18:05:15	dbb0	that command wouldn't do anything
2011-07-16 18:05:39	fsmithred	convert?
2011-07-16 18:05:44	fsmithred	I know it's not complete
2011-07-16 18:05:50	dbb0	ok
2011-07-16 18:05:52	nadir	convert -resize 145x145 12a.png resized.png
2011-07-16 18:05:58	nadir	that seems to do it.
2011-07-16 18:06:01	dbb0	i would probably use double quotes
2011-07-16 18:06:33	dbb0	or an array
2011-07-16 18:06:35	fsmithred	system(convert -resize 145x145 $pic ../thumbnails/$pic);
2011-07-16 18:06:50	dbb0	http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/system.html
2011-07-16 18:07:02	dbb0	i'd probably use a full path too
2011-07-16 18:07:09	@telemachus	You need to quote all that inside the system() bit
2011-07-16 18:07:19	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 18:07:20	@telemachus	or comma separate the bits of it as well
2011-07-16 18:07:34	@telemachus	sometimes handing multi-argument commands to system gets ugly
2011-07-16 18:07:39	fsmithred	quote the whole thing?
2011-07-16 18:07:45	@telemachus	Yes, try that first
2011-07-16 18:07:53	@telemachus	if it fails, you may need to look at more complex options
2011-07-16 18:07:54	fsmithred	thing = complete command you would run
2011-07-16 18:07:57	@telemachus	first try to quote it
2011-07-16 18:07:58	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-16 18:07:59	@telemachus	yes
2011-07-16 18:08:06	dbb0	system "convert -resize 145x145 12a.png resized.png";
2011-07-16 18:08:17	fsmithred	without parens?
2011-07-16 18:08:30	@telemachus	ok, I'm off to scrounge up food
2011-07-16 18:08:33	@telemachus	later guys
2011-07-16 18:08:35	fsmithred	bye

2011-07-18 13:27:07	nadir	well, if yo like you can look, and propose what is to be proposed.
2011-07-18 13:27:13	nadir	still a work in progress.

2011-07-18 13:31:08	nadir	if you like: sure.
2011-07-18 13:31:33	nadir	the bigger part of the whole thing is by you, if i see it correct :-)
2011-07-18 13:31:47	dbb0	lol
2011-07-18 13:41:30	dbb0	posted
2011-07-18 13:42:44	nadir	ah, ok. thanks
2011-07-18 13:42:52	nadir	i am quite happy with the result.
2011-07-18 13:44:17	nadir	mhh... all those chdirs instead of full path is easy:
2011-07-18 13:44:28	nadir	i tested it on several machines, some in ~/Tmp
2011-07-18 13:44:42	nadir	some in ~/Public_Html, some in /var/www
2011-07-18 13:44:55	nadir	i kept it as vague/general as possible
2011-07-18 13:45:40	nadir	for me the result shall be in: /var/www/images/gallery
2011-07-18 13:46:02	dbb0	i would pass the dir as an argument to the script, probably
2011-07-18 13:47:06	nadir	uhum. it will be my project for learning perl.
2011-07-18 13:47:21	nadir	so i will work with it for quite a while. nothing in stone yet.
2011-07-18 13:48:16	nadir	the first thing is that it does "work" at all.
2011-07-18 13:51:52	dbb0	right
2011-07-18 13:52:50	dbb0	let me get your input on something
2011-07-18 13:53:02	nadir	sorry?
2011-07-18 13:53:12	nadir	ah...
2011-07-18 13:53:27	dbb0	your opinion
2011-07-18 13:53:49	nadir	yeah, my first thought was <STDIN>, hence my confusion. shoot
2011-07-18 13:54:08	dbb0	i'm starting a little project that will use simple template files to generate static web pages
2011-07-18 13:54:18	dbb0	mainly for my own personal use
2011-07-18 13:54:29	dbb0	and i'm trying to pick a name
2011-07-18 13:54:51	dbb0	i'll probably use one of these: http://paste.debian.net/123262/
2011-07-18 13:55:19	dbb0	all latin, all contain 'pl' (since it's written in perl), all have a relevant meaning
2011-07-18 13:56:43	nadir	the name for what? for the script/code ?
2011-07-18 13:56:55	nadir	or the website(s) ?
2011-07-18 13:57:19	dbb0	the code
2011-07-18 13:57:40	nadir	and i shall tell which ones i would like?
2011-07-18 13:58:10	nadir	or if i like all of the names, as a general idea?
2011-07-18 13:58:38	dbb0	which one you prefer
2011-07-18 13:58:50	nadir	ok, let me first tell it abstract:
2011-07-18 13:59:04	nadir	some are to hard too remember. Not well known, too long
2011-07-18 13:59:15	nadir	say the first adimpleo.
2011-07-18 13:59:25	nadir	some sound a bit too nice, say:
2011-07-18 13:59:35	nadir	planus
2011-07-18 13:59:39	nadir	The ones i like are:
2011-07-18 13:59:50	nadir	plico plica plexus
2011-07-18 13:59:53	nadir	and simplex
2011-07-18 14:00:10	nadir	I for one would probably pick simplex, as its easy too remember, and seems to make sense
2011-07-18 14:00:21	nadir	(making web-page-making simple)
2011-07-18 14:00:34	nadir	I really hate names which i always forget.
2011-07-18 14:00:45	dbb0	good point
2011-07-18 14:01:23	nadir	if i knew what "plexus" means it would be among the top two too.
2011-07-18 14:01:40	nadir	(for me its very easy to remember... h.miller)
2011-07-18 14:01:56	dbb0	woven
2011-07-18 14:02:28	nadir	oh, now that sounds like a perfect name for what you do.
2011-07-18 14:02:32	dbb0	because the program will take some threads (config files) and weave them into a website
2011-07-18 14:03:24	dbb0	there is a java library called plexus though
2011-07-18 14:04:00	nadir	ok, found it. mhh... not sure if i would care for that.
2011-07-18 14:04:21	nadir	at least all are libplexus***
2011-07-18 14:04:42	nadir	what means plico?
2011-07-18 14:04:45	nadir	sounds good too.
2011-07-18 14:05:14	dbb0	fold or roll up
2011-07-18 14:05:34	nadir	mhhh... good good, though too strong related to pico
2011-07-18 14:05:43	dbb0	it's from the same root as plecto
2011-07-18 14:05:45	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-18 14:06:13	nadir	i for one really would pick plexus, if you got problems with java-libs i would take simplex
2011-07-18 14:06:24	nadir	it means something to people who don't know latin.
2011-07-18 14:06:38	nadir	and a short apt-cache search shows no similar apps
2011-07-18 14:06:56	dbb0	what about plexa, the feminine form
2011-07-18 14:07:02	dbb0	or plexum, neutral
2011-07-18 14:07:17	nadir	well: sure. why not
2011-07-18 14:07:38	nadir	woven seem to hit the nail (besides the h.miller relation...)
2011-07-18 14:08:01	nadir	in case i understood your idea correct, but i thought a lot about something like that, so i think yes.
2011-07-18 14:08:41	nadir	making a web-site should be easy, but the result should be less mainstream (say google sites... all very similar, all the same shit)
2011-07-18 14:08:56	nadir	what do you want to add?
2011-07-18 14:09:06	nadir	gallery? blog?
2011-07-18 14:10:00	dbb0	basically i'm just trying to make it easier to make new individual pages
2011-07-18 14:10:15	dbb0	avoid copying and pasting a lot of HTML over and over
2011-07-18 14:10:39	dbb0	something like jekyll or nanoc, which are written in ruby
2011-07-18 14:10:49	nadir	ah, i did not know them.
2011-07-18 14:11:55	dbb0	tele uses them
2011-07-18 14:12:13	nadir	but yes, what you say is what i meant. a tool to make it easy to make new sites.
2011-07-18 14:12:28	nadir	so you can simply change the content, but not (so much) of the layout
2011-07-18 14:13:02	nadir	i understood that right?
2011-07-18 14:13:05	dbb0	i'm stubborn, so i would rather make my own program that does exactly what i want instead of just learning how to use an existing program
2011-07-18 14:13:09	dbb0	yeah that's the idea
2011-07-18 14:13:26	nadir	yes, i see that. sounds very interesting.
2011-07-18 14:14:14	nadir	you got a time in mind? a few weeks, a few months, more?
2011-07-18 14:14:53	dbb0	i'll probably have a basic version done in a week or two
2011-07-18 14:15:32	nadir	don't hesitate to let me try it.
2011-07-18 14:15:58	nadir	(i guess you know where my level is, ...)
2011-07-18 14:16:34	dbb0	i'm sure you'll be able to give some good suggestions
2011-07-18 14:17:07	nadir	will try, and i fiddle a bit with web-sites/apache right now. anyway.
2011-07-18 14:19:44	nadir	i got to run. See us later. bye.

2011-07-20 10:58:46	nadir	been forking around all night with hurd/kfreebsd/whatnot.
2011-07-20 10:58:57	nadir	holy shit, i got to say: linux is easy and comfortable.
2011-07-20 10:59:09	dbb0	no kidding
2011-07-20 10:59:20	nadir	well: debian linux. slackware/arch and what are hard too (for me)
2011-07-20 10:59:39	dbb0	the last time i used Debian+kFreeBSD it was a nightmare, but that was over a year ago
2011-07-20 10:59:55	nadir	i used it in VBox, also bout a year ago, and it was ok.
2011-07-20 11:00:03	dbb0	arch is still better than gentoo
2011-07-20 11:00:25	nadir	tonight i did it on a pc where i am not sure what all is broken (hard-disks, CD, what not)
2011-07-20 11:00:45	dbb0	probably everything
2011-07-20 11:01:03	nadir	probably :-)
2011-07-20 11:01:12	nadir	had you ever a look at plan9?
2011-07-20 11:01:15	nadir	big fucker too.
2011-07-20 11:01:30	nadir	(ok, ok, nadir seldom reads, which might be a problem...)
2011-07-20 11:02:15	dbb0	yeah, i downloaded it but the CD wouldnt boot on my pc
2011-07-20 11:02:18	dbb0	also tried vbox
2011-07-20 11:03:04	nadir	you did also do a bit of BSD, right?
2011-07-20 11:03:30	dbb0	i used FreeBSD exclusively on one computer for awhile
2011-07-20 11:03:49	nadir	i guess for me it was better to stick to Debian/gnu/linux, learn that properly. I still miss a lot of basics.
2011-07-20 11:03:55	dbb0	i built KDE entirely from source using ports and it worked the first time with no problems
2011-07-20 11:04:00	nadir	for me BSD was a big pain....
2011-07-20 11:04:12	nadir	how long did it take?
2011-07-20 11:04:13	dbb0	but with gentoo after the 3rd time it was still forked up
2011-07-20 11:04:26	nadir	lol
2011-07-20 11:04:35	dbb0	several hours on an Athlon64 2.00gHz single core
2011-07-20 11:05:05	nadir	well: several hours is ok. several days is not so funny.
2011-07-20 11:05:40	dbb0	it took something like 56 hours to build a minimal linux kernel on my AMD K6-II machine
2011-07-20 11:06:04	nadir	yup, same here for a BSD-upgrade. holy shit.
2011-07-20 11:06:08	nadir	i thought i would go nut.
2011-07-20 11:06:59	nadir	i barely know anything but Debian{-based}
2011-07-20 11:07:35	nadir	and if i test i think (after a few days): why on earth should i go through all that trouble.
2011-07-20 11:08:16	nadir	the hurd: -> no shutdown -h
2011-07-20 11:08:22	nadir	wtf?
2011-07-20 11:09:20	dbb0	so how to you shutdown
2011-07-20 11:09:24	dbb0	do you*
2011-07-20 11:09:36	nadir	in short: halt.
2011-07-20 11:09:38	nadir	wait.
2011-07-20 11:09:39	nadir	wait
2011-07-20 11:09:40	nadir	wait.
2011-07-20 11:09:44	nadir	then via button.
2011-07-20 11:09:57	nadir	for qemu the x in the top panel
2011-07-20 11:10:11	nadir	if you use it too early -> fsck next boot.

2011-07-20 11:10:31	nadir	as far i understood, sure.
2011-07-20 11:10:42	nadir	i think its not implemented yet.
2011-07-20 11:11:05	nadir	ah, another good one:
2011-07-20 11:11:10	nadir	$umount yada
2011-07-20 11:11:13	nadir	command not found
2011-07-20 11:11:14	nadir	lol
2011-07-20 11:12:02	nadir	but, like said, i have similar problems with BSD/arch/slackware,
2011-07-20 11:12:10	nadir	i sure am not a geek/reader-of-docus.
2011-07-20 11:12:13	dbb0	is mount not installed
2011-07-20 11:12:20	nadir	in general there seems to be quite progress.
2011-07-20 11:12:25	nadir	yes, mount is installed.
2011-07-20 11:12:30	nadir	but no umount. very strange.
2011-07-20 11:12:35	dbb0	weird
2011-07-20 11:12:46	nadir	to hell with it. i got better things to do.
2011-07-20 11:13:01	nadir	i will let the devs do it, and use it if its noob-proof
2011-07-20 11:16:00	nadir	the funny thing is that i got a test-box Debian-Sid, aka unstable.
2011-07-20 11:16:10	nadir	i compile, i use third party apps, i install, i remove,
2011-07-20 11:16:12	nadir	it works
2011-07-20 11:16:38	nadir	Debian is really good, as in easy to use.
2011-07-20 11:43:51	dbb0	from our standpoint
2011-07-20 11:44:14	dbb0	my brother thinks "nothing works" (compared to ubuntu)
2011-07-20 11:45:12	nadir	ubuntu works, but only for half a year :-)
2011-07-20 11:46:51	nadir	well: for me it only works until i either install a package or remove one.
2011-07-20 11:47:52	nadir	you run testing, btw?
2011-07-20 11:53:32	dbb0	mixed testing/unstable and on occasion some stuff from experimental
2011-07-20 11:53:55	nadir	ah, ok.

2011-07-20 12:07:40	dbb0	which web browser are you using
2011-07-20 12:11:05	nadir	usually iceweasel.
2011-07-20 12:11:33	nadir	kaze is above me
2011-07-20 12:11:37	nadir	chromium sucks.
2011-07-20 12:11:44	nadir	dillo: holy shit....
2011-07-20 12:11:58	nadir	midori and arora seem to be ok.
2011-07-20 12:12:07	nadir	epiphany too, sure.
2011-07-20 12:13:10	nadir	i like the gui apps to be easy, configurable with click-click.
2011-07-20 12:13:24	nadir	if i want to read man or docus, i use cli straight away.
2011-07-20 12:29:40	dbb0	i'm working on some css stuff
2011-07-20 12:29:55	dbb0	trying it just in chrome and ff
2011-07-20 12:30:00	dbb0	i dont care about IE yet
2011-07-20 12:30:04	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-20 12:33:58	dbb0	even though i believe something like 65-70% of all pageviews go to IE
2011-07-20 12:34:33	nadir	i don'T think so.
2011-07-20 12:34:43	nadir	i think its number 2, behind firefox

2011-07-20 12:40:51	nadir	back to topic:
2011-07-20 12:41:00	nadir	why did you ask me bout web-browser?
2011-07-20 12:41:13	dbb0	i was going to have you test the page
2011-07-20 12:41:17	nadir	i right now install all packages on the new Debian Linux, so if you want me too..
2011-07-20 12:41:29	nadir	i can install whichever browser you want, and test.
2011-07-20 12:41:37	nadir	this is a borked test box. no need to take care.
2011-07-20 12:41:58	nadir	(like said above: hardware is falling in pieces....)
2011-07-20 12:42:22	dbb0	which version of ff/iw do you have
2011-07-20 12:42:38	nadir	sec to check (its iw)
2011-07-20 12:42:58	nadir	3.5.16
2011-07-20 12:43:02	nadir	which is debian-stable.
2011-07-20 12:43:46	nadir	like said: i can install whatever you want (i can also test on my other boxes, which are sid, just send me a pm at forum, and i will look later)
2011-07-20 12:44:22	dbb0	that's good

2011-07-20 12:45:10	nadir	at first glance it looks good (though i got a shitty monitor here, my own site is pretty borked)

2011-07-20 12:48:55	nadir	that might well be my monitor.

2011-07-22 14:12:56	nadir	ah, ok, the comments make it clearer.
2011-07-22 14:13:08	nadir	I see the "problem", though i can't say i fully understand.
2011-07-22 14:13:13	nadir	but i got the idea.
2011-07-22 14:13:50	nadir	say: you got a text file, inside of it you got a variable, lets call it $var.
2011-07-22 14:14:03	nadir	if you read from it you get: "$var" literally?
2011-07-22 14:14:20	nadir	if you use eval it gets used as the variable?
2011-07-22 14:14:28	nadir	somehow like that?

2011-07-22 14:16:54	nadir	i am pretty stuck with my addpics code.
2011-07-22 14:17:02	nadir	will have to start with it again.
2011-07-22 14:17:08	nadir	probably from scratch.
2011-07-22 14:17:20	dbb0	you need some help?
2011-07-22 14:17:27	nadir	that would be nice.
2011-07-22 14:17:36	nadir	wait, a new version is at github.
2011-07-22 14:17:48	nadir	i think it makes a bit clearer where i am at loss
2011-07-22 14:18:11	dbb0	ok. 
2011-07-22 14:18:24	dbb0	let me make a sample dir
2011-07-22 14:18:37	nadir	ah.
2011-07-22 14:18:45	nadir	i think i need to do that too.

2011-07-22 14:20:17	dbb0	i'll do: mkdir pics; touch pics/pic{1..3}.png pics/pics.html
2011-07-22 14:20:29	dbb0	or are there different pic dirs?
2011-07-22 14:21:20	dbb0	like pics/gallery pics/old
2011-07-22 14:21:52	nadir	it is in at the top of the code. I hope you can set it there.
2011-07-22 14:22:02	nadir	you need pictures and thumbnails, both in gallery.
2011-07-22 14:22:40	nadir	then you need sub dirs inside of pictures and thumbnails, which tell which pictures they show.
2011-07-22 14:23:00	nadir	say: "wallpapers", "screenshots", "art", "holiday in Cambodia". like that.
2011-07-22 14:25:43	dbb0	ok, lets say you have gallery/sshots/foo.png
2011-07-22 14:25:53	nadir	yes.
2011-07-22 14:25:54	dbb0	what is the thumbnail going to be called
2011-07-22 14:26:01	nadir	it has got the same name.
2011-07-22 14:26:14	nadir	its gallery/pictures/shots/foo.png
2011-07-22 14:26:25	nadir	and gallery/thumbnails/shots/foo.png
2011-07-22 14:26:35	nadir	that is the plan, so far.
2011-07-22 14:26:41	nadir	what i want is:
2011-07-22 14:26:49	dbb0	it might be easier to do: gal/pic/shots/foo.png and gal/pic/shots/foo_th.png
2011-07-22 14:27:05	nadir	for each subdirectoryof pictures, check in the according thumbnails subdir
2011-07-22 14:27:12	nadir	if there is no thumnail, make one.
2011-07-22 14:27:30	nadir	mhh... if you say its easier...
2011-07-22 14:27:42	nadir	my idea is to make it as easy as possible.
2011-07-22 14:27:48	dbb0	what convert command are you using
2011-07-22 14:27:54	nadir	convert.
2011-07-22 14:28:01	nadir	wait.
2011-07-22 14:28:03	dbb0	i mean the whole thing
2011-07-22 14:28:28	dbb0	what size, etc
2011-07-22 14:28:34	nadir	145x145
2011-07-22 14:28:54	nadir	convert -resize 145x145 picture thumbnail
2011-07-22 14:28:56	nadir	i hope
2011-07-22 14:29:04	dbb0	you know, i hate to say it but it might be easier to do this with a shell script
2011-07-22 14:29:13	nadir	ha ha.
2011-07-22 14:29:15	nadir	np.
2011-07-22 14:29:21	dbb0	but if you want to do it in perl we can
2011-07-22 14:29:25	nadir	i think i am too tired and hungry at the moment.
2011-07-22 14:29:37	nadir	if you just wrapped the head around, lets go on.
2011-07-22 14:29:45	nadir	if not: its ok to try at another time.
2011-07-22 14:30:41	nadir	i think the idea to put the thumbnails in the same dir, but call them foo_th.png
2011-07-22 14:30:43	nadir	is a good idea.
2011-07-22 14:31:57	dbb0	i think it should be faster too
2011-07-22 14:32:26	dbb0	are you heading out soon?
2011-07-22 14:32:54	nadir	like said: i started with it, and if you just wrapped the head around, lets move on.
2011-07-22 14:33:14	nadir	i am a bit at a loss right now. i renamed some dirs
2011-07-22 14:33:34	dbb0	heading out = leaving IRC
2011-07-22 14:33:41	nadir	yes, i would prefer too.
2011-07-22 14:33:46	nadir	i am really exhausted.

2011-07-22 14:34:17	dbb0	all right
2011-07-22 14:34:28	nadir	yes? cool.

2011-07-22 14:36:46	nadir	its very confusing.
2011-07-22 14:36:56	dbb0	needlessly complicated
2011-07-22 14:36:59	dbb0	for me
2011-07-22 14:37:07	dbb0	for big projects, probably great
2011-07-22 14:37:25	dbb0	oh well
2011-07-22 14:37:30	nadir	i only use very, very basic features.
2011-07-22 14:37:34	dbb0	same
2011-07-22 14:37:38	nadir	probably not even basic.
2011-07-22 14:37:56	dbb0	push, pull, clone
2011-07-22 14:38:11	dbb0	all right
2011-07-22 14:38:14	dbb0	see you later

2011-07-23 12:27:08	dbb0	hey
2011-07-23 12:32:20	nadir	i think we made some steps with the gallery-perl-code.
2011-07-23 12:32:41	nadir	after we talked yesterday, it bugged me that i was so confused, so i had at it.
2011-07-23 12:33:01	nadir	posted the (confusing) result in the forum, and i think fsmith has shown a good solution.
2011-07-23 12:33:15	nadir	(not saying all is perfect, syntax and all, but it does the job)
2011-07-23 12:37:12	dbb0	good
2011-07-23 12:39:00	nadir	yes, good. thanks again for all your help.
2011-07-23 12:39:09	dbb0	no prob
2011-07-23 12:57:43	@telemachus	hey
2011-07-23 12:58:42	nadir	yo
2011-07-23 13:00:10	@telemachus	So it stayed in the high 90s all last night
2011-07-23 13:00:11	@telemachus	ugh
2011-07-23 13:00:47	nadir	I wear long trousers, a pull-over and all. Very cold
2011-07-23 13:00:52	nadir	for two weeks now
2011-07-23 13:01:03	@telemachus	I wish I were there
2011-07-23 13:01:43	nadir	What is 90 for me?
2011-07-23 13:01:49	nadir	in Celsius?
2011-07-23 13:02:12	@telemachus	hot
2011-07-23 13:02:13	@telemachus	fucking hot
2011-07-23 13:02:30	nadir	lol. that i knew already...
2011-07-23 13:02:47	@telemachus	Ok, during the day yesterday it was over 38C
2011-07-23 13:03:00	@telemachus	at night it was about 33C
2011-07-23 13:03:02	@telemachus	indoors
2011-07-23 13:03:26	nadir	holy shit. now that _is_ fucking hot
2011-07-23 13:04:11	@telemachus	I am glad we agree :)
2011-07-23 13:04:19	@telemachus	I think where dbb0 is it may be worse even
2011-07-23 13:05:30	dbb0	it was in the 90s yesterday, with the rel humidity also upwards of 90%
2011-07-23 13:05:47	dbb0	so the "feels-like" was like 110
2011-07-23 13:06:46	@telemachus	yeah, I never quite follow all that, but here it topped at 101 in Central park (38ishC) real, and 115 with heat index
2011-07-23 13:06:50	@telemachus	fuuuuuuuuuuu
2011-07-23 13:06:53	@telemachus	I hate heat
2011-07-23 13:06:56	@telemachus	total baby about it
2011-07-23 13:06:58	@telemachus	love cold
2011-07-23 13:07:30	dbb0	i like hot dry weather, so i'll probably move to arizona or something
2011-07-23 13:07:36	@telemachus	The craigevil thread(s) at duf and fd suck
2011-07-23 13:07:57	@telemachus	dbb0: dry has to be better, I suppose
2011-07-23 13:08:02	nadir	he has asked for it
2011-07-23 13:08:10	@telemachus	nadir: Oh, I didn't say otherwise
2011-07-23 13:08:16	@telemachus	He should not be a mod.
2011-07-23 13:08:21	@telemachus	That's my two cents.
2011-07-23 13:08:21	nadir	nope
2011-07-23 13:08:22	dbb0	most of the ones i see, he just copies and pastes someone else's article
2011-07-23 13:08:25	nadir	though else i like him
2011-07-23 13:08:33	@telemachus	else I don't
2011-07-23 13:08:36	@telemachus	but that doesn't matter
2011-07-23 13:08:41	nadir	ha ha. ok
2011-07-23 13:08:41	@telemachus	what matters is how he behaves
2011-07-23 13:08:51	nadir	its not ok to have at sossego.
2011-07-23 13:08:52	@telemachus	he removes stuff at random and for personal reasons
2011-07-23 13:08:56	nadir	he is like he is, simply ignore.
2011-07-23 13:09:08	@telemachus	yes, I should
2011-07-23 13:09:09	@telemachus	I know
2011-07-23 13:09:12	@telemachus	I haven't posted
2011-07-23 13:09:16	@telemachus	won't read more
2011-07-23 13:09:20	nadir	no, i mean sossego,
2011-07-23 13:09:26	nadir	no need to give him trouble.
2011-07-23 13:09:27	@telemachus	and dbb0 yeah his posts are like that
2011-07-23 13:09:32	nadir	smxi
2011-07-23 13:09:33	@telemachus	oh, ha
2011-07-23 13:09:36	@telemachus	misunderstood
2011-07-23 13:09:36	nadir	smxi
2011-07-23 13:09:43	nadir	and so on.
2011-07-23 13:09:49	nadir	every fucking problem: use smxi
2011-07-23 13:10:27	dbb0	lol
2011-07-23 13:11:22	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-23 13:11:29	@telemachus	nadir: have you tried smxi?
2011-07-23 13:11:31	@telemachus	I hear it's good
2011-07-23 13:11:38	@telemachus	prolly written in perl
2011-07-23 13:11:41	nadir	me too.
2011-07-23 13:11:57	nadir	I tried, but if i have to read man, i can go for the real command,
2011-07-23 13:12:11	nadir	no need to read the man of a script which helps me to avoid reading the man of a command.
2011-07-23 13:12:26	@telemachus	I was actually kidding completely
2011-07-23 13:12:30	nadir	if prolly is probably: nope, its bash
2011-07-23 13:12:37	@telemachus	to be like ce
2011-07-23 13:12:39	nadir	ah, sorry.
2011-07-23 13:12:41	@telemachus	ah, cool
2011-07-23 13:12:42	@telemachus	no problem
2011-07-23 13:12:46	@telemachus	it's hot
2011-07-23 13:12:48	@telemachus	and I'm a doofus
2011-07-23 13:12:49	dbb0	it's written in bash, last i checked
2011-07-23 13:13:07	nadir	!tr en de doofus
2011-07-23 13:13:07	@antinoos	doofus
2011-07-23 13:13:13	nadir	sighs.

2011-07-23 13:13:37	@telemachus	did we just borrow that from German?
2011-07-23 13:13:45	nadir	doof -> stupid
2011-07-23 13:13:59	nadir	but not good German. children speak
2011-07-23 13:14:03	@telemachus	ah, ok
2011-07-23 13:14:08	dbb0	dummkopf
2011-07-23 13:14:10	@telemachus	so yeah, a doofus is a stupid, silly person
2011-07-23 13:14:12	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-23 13:14:14	nadir	not unusual though. yup, what he siad
2011-07-23 13:14:14	@telemachus	like that
2011-07-23 13:20:53	@telemachus	Ok, I am going to shower off the heat and then go see two or three movies
2011-07-23 13:20:55	@telemachus	Later guys
2011-07-23 13:21:00	@telemachus	I should be around tomorrow

2011-07-23 13:26:10	nadir	so, first things first:
2011-07-23 13:26:14	nadir	you are the man.
2011-07-23 13:26:23	nadir	the code you posted is awesome.
2011-07-23 13:26:33	nadir	Very easy to use.
2011-07-23 13:26:39	fsmithred	couldn't have done it without you
2011-07-23 13:26:48	nadir	well: i am so slow.
2011-07-23 13:26:57	fsmithred	btw...
2011-07-23 13:27:00	nadir	this morning i open the thread, and voile
2011-07-23 13:27:08	fsmithred	I asked you about a line that needed something after it
2011-07-23 13:27:17	fsmithred	your script runs without those lines
2011-07-23 13:27:30	nadir	yeah, it was a dead end,i think
2011-07-23 13:27:32	fsmithred	my $thumbs (@something) {}
2011-07-23 13:27:41	nadir	i put it together yesterday, rather confused.
2011-07-23 13:27:47	nadir	should wait more, before i post
2011-07-23 13:27:50	nadir	too excited.
2011-07-23 13:27:56	fsmithred	that's ok
2011-07-23 13:28:02	nadir	otoh i now got the working code.
2011-07-23 13:28:08	dbb0	nadir: https://gist.github.com/1101651
2011-07-23 13:28:08	nadir	got to move it to the server soon.
2011-07-23 13:28:10	fsmithred	I only needed to edit a few lines
2011-07-23 13:28:27	nadir	system was giving me hard times
2011-07-23 13:28:56	fsmithred	like what?
2011-07-23 13:29:28	nadir	the backticks, and that i needed the full path.
2011-07-23 13:29:31	nadir	such things.
2011-07-23 13:29:36	nadir	dbb0, not sure if i understand
2011-07-23 13:29:46	dbb0	read the comments at the end
2011-07-23 13:29:55	dbb0	it's using the _th naming system
2011-07-23 13:29:58	fsmithred	end of the script?
2011-07-23 13:30:09	nadir	ah, ok. let me bookmark
2011-07-23 13:30:42	dbb0	of course if your server doesn't have zsh then it's useless
2011-07-23 13:31:01	nadir	its not too hard to install it. but to get used to it....
2011-07-23 13:31:29	fsmithred	you don't even have to create the thumbnail folder with the last revision
2011-07-23 13:31:47	dbb0	nadir: the script makes a couple of assumptions
2011-07-23 13:32:05	nadir	dbb0, which one, yours?
2011-07-23 13:32:09	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-23 13:32:30	dbb0	1) any file with the string _th. is a thumbnail
2011-07-23 13:32:40	nadir	ok
2011-07-23 13:32:57	dbb0	2) any thumbnail has a full sized version whose name is the same as the thumb minus the _th
2011-07-23 13:33:14	nadir	ok
2011-07-23 13:33:18	dbb0	3) fullsize-thumb pairs are in the same dir together
2011-07-23 13:34:01	nadir	ok too.
2011-07-23 13:34:04	dbb0	as shown by the `ls -R` at the bottom
2011-07-23 13:34:07	nadir	what you proposed yesterday.
2011-07-23 13:34:24	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-23 13:34:54	nadir	i tried that, but got distracted.
2011-07-23 13:35:11	nadir	i copied it and will save it properly
2011-07-23 13:35:13	dbb0	if you already have 200 pictures, renaming them would be a huge pain
2011-07-23 13:35:21	nadir	nah.
2011-07-23 13:35:34	nadir	its for me only, and i got something much less than 10
2011-07-23 13:35:38	nadir	damn-> 50
2011-07-23 13:35:43	nadir	and it will stay that way
2011-07-23 13:35:56	fsmithred	write a script to rename them
2011-07-23 13:36:52	nadir	ah, yeah.
2011-07-23 13:37:04	fsmithred	oh, one problem with the one that we wrote
2011-07-23 13:37:15	nadir	yes?
2011-07-23 13:37:18	fsmithred	the order of the different sections
2011-07-23 13:37:23	fsmithred	alphabetical
2011-07-23 13:37:30	fsmithred	so...
2011-07-23 13:37:32	nadir	damn, i hoped no one would realize
2011-07-23 13:37:42	fsmithred	for testing, I was using folders named...
2011-07-23 13:37:53	fsmithred	four, one, three and two
2011-07-23 13:38:11	nadir	i see.
2011-07-23 13:38:21	nadir	well: one could, as the most easy workaround, do:
2011-07-23 13:38:23	fsmithred	I haven't given much thought about how to determine a fixed order
2011-07-23 13:38:26	nadir	a)me
2011-07-23 13:38:30	nadir	b)my_friends
2011-07-23 13:38:30	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 13:38:32	nadir	and so forth.
2011-07-23 13:38:37	nadir	not perfect, i see that.
2011-07-23 13:38:38	fsmithred	and nobody would notice
2011-07-23 13:38:49	nadir	i guess there is an easy solution.
2011-07-23 13:38:52	nadir	perlish
2011-07-23 13:39:14	nadir	i for one will first need to get my head into what we got now.
2011-07-23 13:39:22	nadir	move it to the server, and test it in real life
2011-07-23 13:39:38	nadir	the dir structure is a bit hard to keep
2011-07-23 13:39:43	fsmithred	yeah, it should do the job for awhile

2011-07-23 13:39:50	fsmithred	what do you mean?

2011-07-23 13:40:04	nadir	i fear to break it.
2011-07-23 13:40:12	nadir	but i will do it these days.
2011-07-23 13:40:17	nadir	I love that script. Really
2011-07-23 13:40:26	fsmithred	you gonna keep it in /home/someone/public_html?
2011-07-23 13:40:38	nadir	probably Documents.
2011-07-23 13:40:49	nadir	~/Documents/public_html/gallery
2011-07-23 13:40:58	nadir	why? so the user can rsycn new pics
2011-07-23 13:41:07	nadir	i did not find a solution for that yet.
2011-07-23 13:41:12	fsmithred	well, I hadn't thought of that, but yeah
2011-07-23 13:41:14	nadir	www-data is giving me hard times
2011-07-23 13:41:23	nadir	i hate to do so much as root.
2011-07-23 13:41:25	fsmithred	I'm just thinking about what apache expects
2011-07-23 13:41:37	nadir	not in general, but dealing with a web-site should not be done by root
2011-07-23 13:41:45	nadir	no clue about apache.
2011-07-23 13:41:46	fsmithred	I think the default if you set up user directories is $HOME/public_html
2011-07-23 13:41:52	nadir	yes?
2011-07-23 13:41:57	fsmithred	and without an index, it'll just show the contents of that dir
2011-07-23 13:41:58	nadir	if yes: np.
2011-07-23 13:42:11	nadir	uhum. puh... again changing it...
2011-07-23 13:42:34	fsmithred	copy/paste from mine
2011-07-23 13:42:50	nadir	dilberts_left_nut said so too ~/public_html, i assume that is the way then.
2011-07-23 13:43:08	nadir	i try to avoid too much dirs at the top level (~)
2011-07-23 13:43:13	fsmithred	sometimes that directory gets made automatically
2011-07-23 13:43:20	fsmithred	maybe when apache gets installed
2011-07-23 13:43:26	fsmithred	maybe in suse or fedora
2011-07-23 13:43:32	fsmithred	can't remember for sure
2011-07-23 13:43:45	dbb0	nadir: https://gist.github.com/1101651#comments
2011-07-23 13:44:44	nadir	ah, cool. thanks
2011-07-23 13:44:52	nadir	but with bash i am lost?
2011-07-23 13:44:57	nadir	i do need zsh?
2011-07-23 13:45:23	dbb0	i don't know anything about parameter expansion flags in bash. telemachus might though
2011-07-23 13:45:40	fsmithred	what's the (f) about?
2011-07-23 13:45:41	dbb0	(f) splits on \n
2011-07-23 13:45:46	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-23 13:45:57	dbb0	find returns one result per line
2011-07-23 13:47:08	fsmithred	thumbs=$(find $thumb_dir -name '*.png*')
2011-07-23 13:47:18	fsmithred	I think that'll work in bash
2011-07-23 13:47:32	dbb0	but that's a string
2011-07-23 13:47:35	fsmithred	possibly need double-quotes around *.png, but I'm guessing
2011-07-23 13:47:55	fsmithred	you could even avoid that, and put the find command right in the loop
2011-07-23 13:47:58	fsmithred	I've done it
2011-07-23 13:48:10	fsmithred	well, maybe not for rename
2011-07-23 13:48:29	dbb0	for file in $( find foo ); do
2011-07-23 13:48:35	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 13:49:14	fsmithred	might be able to do it with find blah -exec rename whatever
2011-07-23 13:49:39	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-23 13:49:42	fsmithred	guessing that nadir's hands are starting to sweat
2011-07-23 13:49:47	fsmithred	he hates find
2011-07-23 13:49:56	dbb0	what a terrible person
2011-07-23 13:49:57	nadir	and sed too
2011-07-23 13:50:06	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-23 13:50:11	dbb0	i hate sed with a passion
2011-07-23 13:50:19	nadir	yeah, with passion.
2011-07-23 13:50:23	dbb0	it's just simpler in this case
2011-07-23 13:50:33	nadir	"its not your problem you don't understand sed"
2011-07-23 13:50:38	nadir	s/problem/fault
2011-07-23 13:50:41	dbb0	classic
2011-07-23 13:51:03	fsmithred	I understand how to do a couple of things with sed, and I don't expect any more out of it
2011-07-23 13:51:08	fsmithred	therefore, no problem
2011-07-23 13:51:29	nadir	this is our first real perl code, right?
2011-07-23 13:51:31	fsmithred	if you keep your expectations low, you won't be disappointed
2011-07-23 13:51:35	nadir	lol
2011-07-23 13:51:39	fsmithred	um
2011-07-23 13:51:46	fsmithred	didn't we do something before this?
2011-07-23 13:52:01	nadir	i don't think so.
2011-07-23 13:52:12	nadir	i mean something which does something.
2011-07-23 13:52:16	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-23 13:52:18	nadir	not just training.
2011-07-23 13:52:25	fsmithred	we did a few, but they were all for this project
2011-07-23 13:52:27	fsmithred	find-missing
2011-07-23 13:52:30	fsmithred	replace lines
2011-07-23 13:52:31	nadir	ah.
2011-07-23 13:52:52	fsmithred	some dead-ends
2011-07-23 13:52:59	nadir	what i like is that it does not wast resources,
2011-07-23 13:53:08	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 13:53:08	nadir	but then: one has to run it manually...
2011-07-23 13:53:16	fsmithred	not necessarily
2011-07-23 13:53:19	nadir	but 50MB i used for one gallery tool.
2011-07-23 13:53:21	nadir	a bit strange.
2011-07-23 13:53:27	fsmithred	yikes
2011-07-23 13:53:32	nadir	libapache-gallery-perl, i think
2011-07-23 13:53:37	fsmithred	you could make a cron job to run the script
2011-07-23 13:53:41	nadir	yup.
2011-07-23 13:53:53	fsmithred	then all you need to do is add and remove pictures from the pictures folders
2011-07-23 13:53:59	fsmithred	and the rest will take care of itself
2011-07-23 13:54:25	fsmithred	could probably arrange it so that it'll run if the folders change
2011-07-23 13:54:33	nadir	you think so?
2011-07-23 13:54:37	nadir	now that would be good.
2011-07-23 13:54:40	fsmithred	yeah, I'm almost sure of it
2011-07-23 13:54:43	fsmithred	but I don't know how
2011-07-23 13:54:45	nadir	though ssh-ing and running it is ok for me.
2011-07-23 13:55:29	nadir	i will name it: addpics.pl, ok?
2011-07-23 13:55:34	fsmithred	sure
2011-07-23 13:55:40	nadir	good.
2011-07-23 13:55:53	nadir	well: i have to ask, i did not much more than asking
2011-07-23 13:55:55	nadir	:-)
2011-07-23 13:57:25	fsmithred	we should probably try writing it with the fancy globbing to avoid chdir
2011-07-23 13:57:31	fsmithred	not because the script needs it
2011-07-23 13:57:35	fsmithred	just for practice
2011-07-23 13:57:38	nadir	puh.
2011-07-23 13:57:46	nadir	i think opendir/readdir ?
2011-07-23 13:57:56	fsmithred	I only played wiht that a little, and I couldn't get it to work right
2011-07-23 13:58:59	dbb0	here's an example
2011-07-23 13:59:16	dbb0	https://github.com/dbbolton/scripts/blob/master/tint2theme.pl
2011-07-23 13:59:21	dbb0	of readdir, i mean
2011-07-23 13:59:55	dbb0	line 20
2011-07-23 14:00:51	fsmithred	looks pretty straightforward
2011-07-23 14:01:18	fsmithred	not clear on what the script is doing
2011-07-23 14:01:27	fsmithred	delete if it's not a regular file?
2011-07-23 14:02:12	dbb0	'delete' meaning remove from the array
2011-07-23 14:02:21	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-23 14:03:17	fsmithred	I need to go outside for a smoke break
2011-07-23 14:03:29	fsmithred	5-10 min
2011-07-23 14:03:47	fsmithred	what's our next project?
2011-07-23 14:04:06	fsmithred	actually, I've got a topic, but little or no information
2011-07-23 14:04:09	dbb0	by default, . and .. are included in the list, like with ls -a
2011-07-23 14:04:10	fsmithred	about html files
2011-07-23 14:04:24	fsmithred	oh, yeah, that makes sense
2011-07-23 14:04:49	fsmithred	nadir, you know anything about yahoo html editor?
2011-07-23 14:04:57	nadir	no
2011-07-23 14:05:00	nadir	never heard of it.
2011-07-23 14:05:02	fsmithred	oh well
2011-07-23 14:05:07	fsmithred	neither did I
2011-07-23 14:05:34	fsmithred	friend has a job to find something that anyone can use to edit web pages
2011-07-23 14:05:52	fsmithred	he wants to use something that's open, and use real html
2011-07-23 14:06:02	fsmithred	some of the pages were made with proprietary code
2011-07-23 14:06:10	fsmithred	he's started to fix them manually
2011-07-23 14:06:25	fsmithred	I suggested that there might be a way to script it
2011-07-23 14:06:36	fsmithred	anyway, I'm on the verge of getting the shakes
2011-07-23 14:06:39	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-23 14:06:42	nadir	ok
2011-07-23 14:08:23	dbb0	i think i'm going to take a break from perl in favor of js
2011-07-23 14:08:34	nadir	buh
2011-07-23 14:08:49	nadir	:-)
2011-07-23 14:10:05	dbb0	buh?
2011-07-23 14:10:30	nadir	i don't like javascript, without really knowing it.
2011-07-23 14:10:48	dbb0	i don't like it either
2011-07-23 14:10:55	nadir	probably i don't like it only cause i ain't got the time to learn it
2011-07-23 14:11:08	dbb0	but running programs on a website, very cool
2011-07-23 14:12:49	dbb0	http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/750
2011-07-23 14:13:20	nadir	how can i use "say" if i ain't got version 5.012_003 ?
2011-07-23 14:17:56	dbb0	use 5.010;
2011-07-23 14:18:16	dbb0	works on 5.10 and up
2011-07-23 14:18:48	nadir	ah,ok that one is on squeeze. thanks
2011-07-23 14:18:49	dbb0	sub say { print "$_\n" for @_; }
2011-07-23 14:19:13	dbb0	5.10 is even in lenny
2011-07-23 14:21:07	dbb0	i miss the good old days of running kde 3 on knoppix cds
2011-07-23 14:21:23	nadir	i miss the kde3 too
2011-07-23 14:21:37	nadir	i did never use knoppix much
2011-07-23 14:22:05	dbb0	now i mainly just use slitaz if i need a live disk
2011-07-23 14:22:13	nadir	i usually use antix
2011-07-23 14:22:17	nadir	or refracta
2011-07-23 14:22:44	dbb0	what is antix based on
2011-07-23 14:22:49	nadir	debian.
2011-07-23 14:23:03	nadir	you know there is/was a lxde version of knoppix, right?
2011-07-23 14:23:50	fsmithred	back
2011-07-23 14:24:07	nadir	yup.
2011-07-23 14:24:33	fsmithred	say didn't work for me in squeeze
2011-07-23 14:25:25	nadir	for me too. i install perlbrew right now.
2011-07-23 14:25:32	nadir	damn, i would rather not have done that.
2011-07-23 14:25:38	fsmithred	you getting good at that?
2011-07-23 14:25:43	nadir	but now i moved all files around (already)
2011-07-23 14:25:52	nadir	good at perlbrew? hell:no
2011-07-23 14:25:59	dbb0	nadir: yeah, that's why i said i missed the good old days
2011-07-23 14:26:02	nadir	i go to telemachus site, and do copy and paste
2011-07-23 14:26:12	fsmithred	I figure a couple more times, and I'll start to remember the procedure
2011-07-23 14:26:36	nadir	dbb0, i don't think kde4 is that bad, i could use it, but its not really of my taste.
2011-07-23 14:26:40	nadir	i _loved_ kde3
2011-07-23 14:26:42	dbb0	say didn't work when you included use 5.010; in perl 5.10 ?
2011-07-23 14:26:54	nadir	oh, no.
2011-07-23 14:27:04	fsmithred	didn't try that
2011-07-23 14:27:05	nadir	i did not say: "use 5.010".
2011-07-23 14:27:07	nadir	damn
2011-07-23 14:27:27	dbb0	i was going to say, there is a serious problem
2011-07-23 14:27:51	fsmithred	but you had to print it instead?
2011-07-23 14:27:56	dbb0	no
2011-07-23 14:28:13	fsmithred	sorry, my brain is a bit fried
2011-07-23 14:28:23	fsmithred	up too late last night, after a stressful day
2011-07-23 14:28:27	dbb0	put 'use 5.010;' at the beginning of the program
2011-07-23 14:28:47	dbb0	that pragma will give you access to 'say' on versions 5.10 and up
2011-07-23 14:28:59	fsmithred	thanks
2011-07-23 14:29:12	nadir	use worked, dbb0
2011-07-23 14:29:14	nadir	as far i see
2011-07-23 14:29:45	dbb0	my say function was kind of a joke, but it would work in a pinch
2011-07-23 14:30:39	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/content/misc.content/gallery.html
2011-07-23 14:30:44	nadir	not perfect yet.
2011-07-23 14:30:45	nadir	ha ha.
2011-07-23 14:31:08	fsmithred	I don't see any pics
2011-07-23 14:31:57	nadir	thats what i mean with:not perfect.
2011-07-23 14:32:03	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-23 14:32:07	nadir	i have borked my directory-swicheridoo
2011-07-23 14:32:17	nadir	i will get it fixed. np
2011-07-23 14:34:33	dbb0	amy winehouse dies
2011-07-23 14:34:36	dbb0	dies
2011-07-23 14:34:40	dbb0	died, christ
2011-07-23 14:34:42	nadir	who?
2011-07-23 14:35:01	dbb0	some skank
2011-07-23 14:36:33	dbb0	a "famous" singer
2011-07-23 14:37:49	fsmithred	http://www.hollywoodgrind.com/amy-winehouse-before-drugs/
2011-07-23 14:38:34	dbb0	i like the second one better
2011-07-23 14:38:44	nadir	yup
2011-07-23 14:39:04	fsmithred	oh, I like the first one better
2011-07-23 14:39:09	fsmithred	guess I'm an old fart
2011-07-23 14:39:38	dbb0	i think i might be the baby of this chat room
2011-07-23 14:39:49	fsmithred	good chance of that
2011-07-23 14:40:17	fsmithred	in fact, there's a good chance I'm twice your age
2011-07-23 14:41:10	dbb0	44?
2011-07-23 14:41:16	fsmithred	57
2011-07-23 14:41:37	fsmithred	don't look it or act it, though
2011-07-23 14:42:25	dbb0	that's about how old my dad is
2011-07-23 14:42:51	fsmithred	you got him running linux?
2011-07-23 14:43:33	dbb0	my parents told me they were sick of viruses so they're using debian stable with xfce now
2011-07-23 14:43:41	fsmithred	cool
2011-07-23 14:44:33	dbb0	what baffles me is that he loves machines, but isn't remotely interested in how software works
2011-07-23 14:44:35	fsmithred	I put debian on a 4GB hard drive for a friend to try
2011-07-23 14:44:45	fsmithred	after awhile, the hard drive died
2011-07-23 14:44:57	fsmithred	she called me up and said, "I want my debian back!"
2011-07-23 14:45:45	fsmithred	She's still running it on a 1.2GHz athlon, and just starting to notice that it's a little slow
2011-07-23 14:46:40	fsmithred	maybe it's not mechanical enough for him
2011-07-23 14:46:58	fsmithred	he can't picture in his mind how it works
2011-07-23 14:48:01	fsmithred	nadir, I think the internet connection is fixed here
2011-07-23 14:48:14	nadir	ah, i wanted to ask you about it.
2011-07-23 14:48:16	fsmithred	so I should be able to meet tomorrow from home
2011-07-23 14:48:22	nadir	ok.
2011-07-23 14:48:31	nadir	i am fighting with the web-site.
2011-07-23 14:48:35	nadir	something does not work.
2011-07-23 14:48:44	nadir	probably about ownerships and rights or so.
2011-07-23 14:48:44	fsmithred	yeah, the ISP got a phone call and might have sent a tech out while I was gone the other day
2011-07-23 14:48:55	nadir	as fari see the paths are all correct.
2011-07-23 14:49:07	nadir	so hope is high?
2011-07-23 14:49:20	fsmithred	content/ does not have any subdirectories
2011-07-23 14:49:33	fsmithred	where's gallery/ ?
2011-07-23 14:49:41	fsmithred	pictures/
2011-07-23 14:49:44	fsmithred	thumbnails
2011-07-23 14:50:02	nadir	puh.
2011-07-23 14:50:07	nadir	i got so many dirs.
2011-07-23 14:50:07	fsmithred	sorry...
2011-07-23 14:50:12	nadir	in home its:
2011-07-23 14:50:15	fsmithred	misc.content has no subdirs
2011-07-23 14:50:31	nadir	~/public_html/gallery
2011-07-23 14:50:37	fsmithred	well...
2011-07-23 14:50:41	nadir	inside is pictures and thumbnails.
2011-07-23 14:50:44	fsmithred	that's where gallery.html should be
2011-07-23 14:50:46	nadir	something/somewhere.
2011-07-23 14:50:50	nadir	there it is
2011-07-23 14:50:52	fsmithred	and if needed
2011-07-23 14:50:59	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-23 14:51:22	fsmithred	and also author_info.html and blog.html?
2011-07-23 14:51:42	nadir	they are at /var/www/content
2011-07-23 14:51:49	fsmithred	so is gallery.html
2011-07-23 14:51:57	fsmithred	move those files
2011-07-23 14:52:14	fsmithred	then make a symlink
2011-07-23 14:52:17	fsmithred	or
2011-07-23 14:52:25	nadir	i made a symlink
2011-07-23 14:52:27	nadir	look:
2011-07-23 14:52:38	fsmithred	maybe you have to mess with the apache config files to enable home dirs
2011-07-23 14:52:50	fsmithred	rmdir content
2011-07-23 14:52:51	nadir	ROOT@backup-server# pwd
2011-07-23 14:52:51	nadir	/var/www/content/misc.content

2011-07-23 14:52:56		[dbb0 away: essen]
2011-07-23 14:52:58	nadir	ROOT@backup-server#
2011-07-23 14:53:07	nadir	i probably oversee the obvious.
2011-07-23 14:53:16	fsmithred	you have to link the whole dir
2011-07-23 14:53:19	fsmithred	not just the file
2011-07-23 14:53:24	fsmithred	rmdir content
2011-07-23 14:53:56	nadir	huh?
2011-07-23 14:53:56	fsmithred	ln -s /home/molloy/public_html/gallery /var/www/content/misc.content
2011-07-23 14:53:59	fsmithred	I think
2011-07-23 14:54:17	nadir	i think that is what i did.
2011-07-23 14:54:26	nadir	huh? no
2011-07-23 14:54:33	nadir	i did only link the gallery.html
2011-07-23 14:54:34	fsmithred	looks like gallery.html is the symlink
2011-07-23 14:54:39	nadir	the whole dir you say?
2011-07-23 14:54:44	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 14:55:36	fsmithred	and if you rename the file to index.html, it'll be the default page
2011-07-23 14:55:44	fsmithred	but then you'll need to edit the script
2011-07-23 14:56:06	nadir	to hell with it.
2011-07-23 14:56:18	nadir	why on earth can't it read home?
2011-07-23 14:56:27	nadir	i evne changed ownership to www-data
2011-07-23 14:56:33	fsmithred	The requested URL /home/molloy/public_html/gallery/pictures/a)_me/wplace1.jpg was not found on this server.
2011-07-23 14:57:09	fsmithred	actually, I think you need to do something to enable the site
2011-07-23 14:57:17	nadir	uhum
2011-07-23 14:57:23	nadir	more difficult than i have assumed.
2011-07-23 14:57:42	nadir	i think i will quit doing things in home. too much fiddling
2011-07-23 14:57:49	fsmithred	hang on
2011-07-23 14:58:28	nadir	puh, i want beer.
2011-07-23 14:59:01	fsmithred	look in /etc/apache2/mods-available and mods-enabled
2011-07-23 14:59:12	fsmithred	there's one called user-dir.load
2011-07-23 14:59:18	fsmithred	might want to enable that
2011-07-23 14:59:32	fsmithred	then, I'm not sure if you need to create a virtual host for it or not
2011-07-23 14:59:44	fsmithred	that part is black magic to me
2011-07-23 15:00:06	nadir	tell me
2011-07-23 15:00:26	nadir	ok, short break with it.
2011-07-23 15:00:42	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-23 15:00:48	nadir	no, just me.
2011-07-23 15:00:50	fsmithred	try linking the whole directory first
2011-07-23 15:00:55	nadir	tried it,
2011-07-23 15:00:58	nadir	no luck
2011-07-23 15:00:58	fsmithred	so, having to be root is not a problem
2011-07-23 15:01:07	fsmithred	stick it all in /var/www/gallery
2011-07-23 15:01:11	nadir	yup
2011-07-23 15:01:20	nadir	kiss, keep it simple
2011-07-23 15:01:37	fsmithred	then just go to host/galler
2011-07-23 15:01:39	fsmithred	y
2011-07-23 15:01:56	fsmithred	or host/gallery/gallery.html
2011-07-23 15:02:04	fsmithred	if there's no index.html
2011-07-23 15:02:10	fsmithred	or...
2011-07-23 15:02:23	fsmithred	edit some file to recognize gallery.html as the index page
2011-07-23 15:02:49	fsmithred	but that's no longer simple
2011-07-23 15:03:25	fsmithred	ok, old man here needs a nap
2011-07-23 15:03:29	fsmithred	I was up way too late
2011-07-23 15:03:51	nadir	np.
2011-07-23 15:03:58	nadir	i will eat and have a nap too.
2011-07-23 15:04:00	nadir	i hope
2011-07-23 15:04:00	fsmithred	see you tomorrow?
2011-07-23 15:04:22	fsmithred	dbb0, thanks for your help

2011-07-23 22:17:13	fsmithred	not good
2011-07-23 22:17:18	nadir	oh?
2011-07-23 22:17:19	fsmithred	playing with apache
2011-07-23 22:17:25	nadir	urgh.
2011-07-23 22:17:26	fsmithred	gallery don't work
2011-07-23 22:17:41	nadir	mhhh... not sure if i tried it at all.
2011-07-23 22:17:42	fsmithred	like yours, all I see is boxes that say "description"
2011-07-23 22:17:43	nadir	i think: no
2011-07-23 22:17:49	fsmithred	and links don't work
2011-07-23 22:17:51	nadir	ah.
2011-07-23 22:18:04	nadir	tell me the paths, if you like
2011-07-23 22:18:04	fsmithred	I put everything in /var/www/gallery
2011-07-23 22:18:08	nadir	ah, ok
2011-07-23 22:18:51	nadir	did you read the tip by the other user. wait, i check for the package name.
2011-07-23 22:19:26	nadir	llgal
2011-07-23 22:19:44	nadir	he said its easy, but i had no time yet.
2011-07-23 22:19:54	fsmithred	the links should not say /var/www/gallery/whatever
2011-07-23 22:20:01	nadir	ah, wait.
2011-07-23 22:20:11	fsmithred	they should probably say http://localhost/gallery/whatever
2011-07-23 22:20:13	nadir	try relative paths.
2011-07-23 22:20:27	nadir	i got no clue why, but absolute paths don't work here.
2011-07-23 22:20:39	fsmithred	document root
2011-07-23 22:20:48	nadir	i have to do things like ./pictures/lah.png
2011-07-23 22:20:54	fsmithred	webserver does not show the local directory full path
2011-07-23 22:20:57	nadir	everywhere in /var/www
2011-07-23 22:21:29	nadir	what is inside of /var/www/gallery?
2011-07-23 22:21:41	fsmithred	pictures/
2011-07-23 22:21:45	fsmithred	thumbnails/
2011-07-23 22:21:49	fsmithred	gallery.html
2011-07-23 22:21:59	fsmithred	and script
2011-07-23 22:22:01	nadir	yes. damn, are we good. just the same.
2011-07-23 22:22:10	nadir	wait, you mean our script?
2011-07-23 22:22:17	fsmithred	y
2011-07-23 22:22:28	nadir	lol. i thought you meant the package.
2011-07-23 22:22:39	nadir	ok. in that case its more easy for me.
2011-07-23 22:22:52	fsmithred	Can't chdir('thumbnails'): No such file or directory at add_pics_to_html_9.pl line 30
2011-07-23 22:22:54	nadir	can you gist gallery.html?
2011-07-23 22:23:05	nadir	yeah, you need to change a bit.
2011-07-23 22:23:20	nadir	i got it pushed to github.
2011-07-23 22:23:24	fsmithred	<a href="/var/www/gallery/pictures/1ne/October_snow.jpg"><img src="/var/www/gal$
2011-07-23 22:23:37	fsmithred	shouldn't that be a web address?
2011-07-23 22:23:37	nadir	sec for the link, you need to add a few chdir($work_dir)
2011-07-23 22:23:59	nadir	like said: for me only relative paths work. NO idea why.
2011-07-23 22:25:09	nadir	here are my changes, after i moved it to /var/www, search for chdir
2011-07-23 22:25:14	nadir	https://github.com/tornow/web-site/blob/463af763f14f42e033710fc9ae82b408b54accc8/images/gallery/addpics.pl
2011-07-23 22:25:24	nadir	here is my resulting gallery.html:

2011-07-23 22:26:00	nadir	more i can't say: add chdirs to get rid of the line30 error.
2011-07-23 22:26:04	nadir	use relative paths.
2011-07-23 22:26:14	fsmithred	hang on, I'm trying something
2011-07-23 22:26:16	nadir	that kinda worked for me, but still very dirty.
2011-07-23 22:26:18	nadir	yup.
2011-07-23 22:26:31	nadir	side note: -> big trouble.
2011-07-23 22:26:38	nadir	the gallery/apache thing
2011-07-23 22:26:46	fsmithred	fixed it
2011-07-23 22:26:49	fsmithred	in geany
2011-07-23 22:26:59	fsmithred	find and replace /var/www with http://localhost
2011-07-23 22:27:07	nadir	ah, and that works?
2011-07-23 22:27:17	fsmithred	of course
2011-07-23 22:27:22	fsmithred	they're supposed to be links
2011-07-23 22:27:28	fsmithred	not paths
2011-07-23 22:27:35	nadir	(stupid question, if someone says: fixed it, and then ask: and it did work?... oh my)
2011-07-23 22:27:45	fsmithred	paths work if you just open the html file in a browser
2011-07-23 22:27:53	fsmithred	links work if you go to the website
2011-07-23 22:28:20	fsmithred	well, I understood the question to mean...
2011-07-23 22:28:24	fsmithred	was it really that easy?
2011-07-23 22:28:37	nadir	mhhh... might be that would have solved my trouble with ~/public_html too...
2011-07-23 22:28:47	fsmithred	just need to edit my $line
2011-07-23 22:28:58	fsmithred	maybe
2011-07-23 22:29:13	nadir	i also made a few changes, so that the resulting html is a bit better structured.
2011-07-23 22:29:22	nadir	-> added some \n
2011-07-23 22:31:50	nadir	i would prefer localhost instead of all those ../../
2011-07-23 22:31:54	nadir	hard to read.
2011-07-23 22:32:10	nadir	but not tonight.
2011-07-23 22:33:50	fsmithred	ok, it fixes it in /home/me/public_html
2011-07-23 22:34:14	nadir	holy shit. you save me, once again.
2011-07-23 22:34:25	nadir	i would have never thought of that.
2011-07-23 22:34:36	nadir	now i can rewrite it all once again... duh.
2011-07-23 22:34:44	fsmithred	replace /home/user/public_html with http://localhost/user
2011-07-23 22:34:45	fsmithred	and
2011-07-23 22:35:05	fsmithred	ln -s /home/user/public_html /var/www/user
2011-07-23 22:35:39	fsmithred	make sure to reload the page in the browser when you're testing
2011-07-23 22:36:25	fsmithred	then add a link to gallery.html in your index.html in public_html
2011-07-23 22:36:26	fsmithred	or
2011-07-23 22:36:42	fsmithred	if you're only going to have the gallery
2011-07-23 22:37:01	fsmithred	rename gallery.html to index.html and make sure it's in the top-level directory of that website
2011-07-23 22:37:10	fsmithred	public_html in my example
2011-07-23 22:37:18	fsmithred	and adjust the script
2011-07-23 22:37:28	nadir	yup. and yup, i will go for public_html too.
2011-07-23 22:37:30	fsmithred	that's probably a shitty explanation
2011-07-23 22:37:39	nadir	nope, its ok
2011-07-23 22:37:42	nadir	rather good.
2011-07-23 22:37:44	fsmithred	cool
2011-07-23 22:37:58	nadir	i will probably have to ask again, but i got the general idea.
2011-07-23 22:38:02	fsmithred	been playing around with this shit for years, and I still don't understand it
2011-07-23 22:38:07	fsmithred	but I can often do it
2011-07-23 22:38:37	nadir	what i really would like to get rid of is to have to be root all the time.
2011-07-23 22:38:46	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 22:38:50	fsmithred	this should do it
2011-07-23 22:39:15	nadir	i will try. now its short before dawn (dusk?), so not now.
2011-07-23 22:39:20	fsmithred	oh, I just thought of something else
2011-07-23 22:39:23	nadir	but tomorrow or on monday.
2011-07-23 22:39:27	nadir	yes?
2011-07-23 22:39:27	fsmithred	in the section titles
2011-07-23 22:39:38	fsmithred	a) me
2011-07-23 22:39:41	fsmithred	etc...
2011-07-23 22:39:45	nadir	ok.
2011-07-23 22:39:57	fsmithred	can you make the a) the same color as the background?
2011-07-23 22:40:04	fsmithred	kind of a cheat, but it should work
2011-07-23 22:40:17	nadir	wait, let me look. isn't it.
2011-07-23 22:40:24	nadir	ah, the color of the font?
2011-07-23 22:40:29	nadir	yeah, that should work
2011-07-23 22:40:34	fsmithred	yeah, make it invisible
2011-07-23 22:40:37	nadir	though i would not know how, right now
2011-07-23 22:40:39	fsmithred	it'll still sort by that
2011-07-23 22:40:44	nadir	to/for me its ok.
2011-07-23 22:41:00	nadir	the space sucks, i tried: -> a)_me
2011-07-23 22:41:04	nadir	but that i did not like
2011-07-23 22:41:15	fsmithred	maybe use a tab?
2011-07-23 22:41:33	nadir	mkdir "a)\t me" ?
2011-07-23 22:41:44	fsmithred	oh, not sure
2011-07-23 22:41:54	nadir	for me its ok.
2011-07-23 22:42:04	nadir	first i need to get all my directories sorted.
2011-07-23 22:42:05	fsmithred	no, you're not making a directory there
2011-07-23 22:42:19	fsmithred	you're just injecting some html text into the page
2011-07-23 22:42:26	fsmithred	mkdir me
2011-07-23 22:42:37	fsmithred	but then using a custom format
2011-07-23 22:43:03	fsmithred	<h2>me</h2>
2011-07-23 22:43:25	fsmithred	<h2><font white>me</h2>
2011-07-23 22:43:32	fsmithred	except using correct html
2011-07-23 22:43:46	fsmithred	oops
2011-07-23 22:44:03	fsmithred	<h2><font white>a)<font blue>me</h2>
2011-07-23 22:44:45	fsmithred	make sense?
2011-07-23 22:45:00	nadir	i am very tired. in general yes.
2011-07-23 22:45:06	nadir	in detail: not so much.
2011-07-23 22:45:30	nadir	that whole thing makes me forget how my name is, which day, which age...
2011-07-23 22:45:35	nadir	very confusing.
2011-07-23 22:45:36	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-23 22:45:51	nadir	really. I never know: where is what, why is it there.
2011-07-23 22:45:56	nadir	what happens if i move it.
2011-07-23 22:46:04	fsmithred	html or perl?
2011-07-23 22:46:25	nadir	i think the structure of /var/www is worse than perl, right now
2011-07-23 22:47:34	nadir	+ trying to use ~/public_html too, which does not make it better.
2011-07-23 22:47:49	nadir	(but now i got your localhost tip, if that works all will get a lot better)
2011-07-23 22:49:35	fsmithred	might need to make another variable in the script
2011-07-23 22:49:38	nadir	well: and i did never do much linking.
2011-07-23 22:49:47	fsmithred	for the beginning of the url
2011-07-23 22:50:07	fsmithred	still need the paths for manipulating the files
2011-07-23 22:50:19	fsmithred	but can't use the paths in the html code
2011-07-23 22:50:27	fsmithred	need the website
2011-07-23 22:50:42	nadir	and "convert " is a bit touchy too, if i recall correct.
2011-07-23 22:50:47	nadir	with paths, that is.
2011-07-23 22:51:50	nadir	if a web-dev would see how i hack it together, he would cry in pain.
2011-07-23 22:52:01	nadir	i try until it works, however it looks
2011-07-23 22:52:45	fsmithred	yeah, that last suggestion requires more thought
2011-07-23 22:52:51	fsmithred	we can figure it out tomorrow
2011-07-23 22:53:01	fsmithred	well, whenever
2011-07-23 22:53:09	fsmithred	13 hours from now
2011-07-23 22:53:25	nadir	lets hope i will sleep 12 of them...
2011-07-23 22:53:29	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-23 22:54:24	nadir	you got it at github?
2011-07-23 22:54:29	fsmithred	no
2011-07-23 22:54:44	nadir	ok.
2011-07-23 22:54:54	fsmithred	no perl there yet
2011-07-23 22:55:02	nadir	check for my insertion of -> \n
2011-07-23 22:55:19	nadir	as far its me the resulting html is more easy to read.
2011-07-23 22:56:30	nadir	for example:
2011-07-23 22:56:34	nadir	my $header = << "EOF";
2011-07-23 22:56:35	nadir	<!doctype html>
2011-07-23 22:56:35	nadir	\n<html>
2011-07-23 22:56:35	nadir	\n<head>
2011-07-23 22:56:43	nadir	i added a few of those, and i like it.
2011-07-23 22:57:10	nadir	makes more sense when it comes to the sub-directories of picutures.
2011-07-23 22:58:22	nadir	as i had to do more than one tests today:
2011-07-23 22:58:43	nadir	most of what you added (deleting orphaned thumbs and such) did work. and like a charme
2011-07-23 23:00:26	fsmithred	might need to split up the paths into more than one variable each
2011-07-23 23:01:25	fsmithred	one for the beginning, one for the end
2011-07-23 23:01:46	nadir	sorry?
2011-07-23 23:01:58	nadir	(five in the morning, bare with me)
2011-07-23 23:02:14	fsmithred	my $work_dir = "$ENV{HOME}/public_html
2011-07-23 23:02:28	nadir	ok
2011-07-23 23:02:30	fsmithred	my pictures_dir = $work_dir/pictures
2011-07-23 23:02:34	fsmithred	or
2011-07-23 23:03:01	fsmithred	my url = "http://localhost/me
2011-07-23 23:03:09	nadir	ah, ok, i think i got you.
2011-07-23 23:03:32	nadir	one for moving around, one for the resulting html
2011-07-23 23:03:34	fsmithred	my $line = <href $url/$pictures_dir
2011-07-23 23:03:40	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-23 23:04:04	nadir	holy crap, this whole thing is so cool.
2011-07-23 23:04:11	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-23 23:04:49	fsmithred	ok, go dream on it
2011-07-23 23:05:01	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-23 23:05:04	nadir	one last thing.
2011-07-23 23:05:08	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-23 23:05:11	nadir	my hurd-install is getting better.
2011-07-23 23:05:21	nadir	not that it changes much for  me, but its a bit of fun.
2011-07-23 23:05:23	fsmithred	oh, I haven't been paying attention to that
2011-07-23 23:05:34	nadir	there is a new Debian CD out.
2011-07-23 23:05:52	nadir	and its better than in the past (still painful, but much better)
2011-07-23 23:06:16	nadir	i do it as kind of a PC-game.
2011-07-23 23:06:26	nadir	not as a serious thing.
2011-07-23 23:07:36	fsmithred	everything runs?
2011-07-23 23:07:36	nadir	i got X, i got networking, i ain't got a proper PATH for root.
2011-07-23 23:07:49	nadir	everything is .... a lot.
2011-07-23 23:07:52	nadir	it runs.
2011-07-23 23:07:57	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-23 23:08:05	nadir	but X is quite a new thing to me.
2011-07-23 23:08:18	nadir	but every little thing needs reading.
2011-07-23 23:08:33	nadir	anyway: if they release it with wheezy, it might be worth a shot.
2011-07-23 23:08:44	nadir	(assuming one has a lot of time)
2011-07-23 23:09:13	fsmithred	I don't have time to play with that
2011-07-23 23:09:20	nadir	yup, i see.
2011-07-23 23:09:31	nadir	me neither. i play a bit, but thats it.
2011-07-23 23:09:40	fsmithred	gonna have to do some serious refracta in the next couple months, I think
2011-07-23 23:09:47	nadir	ah, yeah, that too.
2011-07-23 23:10:02	nadir	not sure what i did wrong, but, like said: re-installation solved it.
2011-07-23 23:10:17	fsmithred	that's good
2011-07-23 23:10:33	fsmithred	probably something you changed and then forgot about it
2011-07-23 23:10:40	nadir	yes, i think too.
2011-07-23 23:11:25	fsmithred	ok. get some sleep
2011-07-23 23:11:27	nadir	tomorrow at 6:00, umf, that is my timezone.
2011-07-23 23:11:32	nadir	tomorrow like usual.
2011-07-23 23:11:33	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-23 23:11:35	nadir	bye, and thanks
2011-07-23 23:11:38	fsmithred	g'night

2011-07-24 13:29:37	fsmithred	I'm about to take a break
2011-07-24 13:29:40	nadir	ok.
2011-07-24 13:29:45	nadir	i will eat and all.
2011-07-24 13:29:48	nadir	fart a bit.
2011-07-24 13:29:53	fsmithred	bb in 10 min, maybe a little more
2011-07-24 13:30:05	nadir	ah, ok. in that case: coffee, no eating.
2011-07-24 13:30:14	nadir	let me configure refracta a bit.
2011-07-24 13:30:19	dbb0	hey

2011-07-24 13:32:07	fsmithred	check if "use Cwd;" is in there
2011-07-24 13:32:17	fsmithred	It should be gone, but I'm seeing it
2011-07-24 13:32:21	fsmithred	bbiab
2011-07-24 13:33:26	nadir	its gone on my local copy.
2011-07-24 13:36:44	dbb0	whats the action
2011-07-24 13:37:27	nadir	we talked mostly about fsmithreds version to creat a gallery,
2011-07-24 13:37:46	nadir	and about how to deal with the website being hosted at ~/public_html
2011-07-24 13:37:52	nadir	and how to set the paths then
2011-07-24 13:37:57	nadir	if that was your question?
2011-07-24 13:38:03	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-24 13:38:12	dbb0	just means whats up
2011-07-24 13:38:42	nadir	ah, and about refracta.
2011-07-24 13:39:01	nadir	did you know that debconf is getting streamed?
2011-07-24 13:39:10	dbb0	no
2011-07-24 13:39:26	nadir	they kept that a good secret.
2011-07-24 13:39:32	dbb0	why
2011-07-24 13:39:42	nadir	http://debconf11.debconf.org/watch.xhtml#tab-three
2011-07-24 13:39:54	nadir	http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/index.en.html
2011-07-24 13:42:10	dbb0	i probably wouldn't watch anyway
2011-07-24 13:42:26	dbb0	last year i didn't hear about anything very interesting
2011-07-24 13:42:50	dbb0	it was in new york too, so that was probably the only chance i'll ever have to go to one
2011-07-24 13:43:42	nadir	i will perhaps some of the talks of bdale.
2011-07-24 13:43:46	nadir	assuming i am awake.
2011-07-24 13:46:32	nadir	File::Path you say?
2011-07-24 13:49:19	dbb0	if there's a module for it, i don't use system()
2011-07-24 13:49:28	nadir	yup, got that. i think
2011-07-24 13:50:44	dbb0	where's the current version of the script
2011-07-24 13:51:17	nadir	$ git clone git://github.com/fsmithred/perl
2011-07-24 13:57:30	fsmithred	https://github.com/fsmithred/perl/blob/aac080761d21359540fd5142fdc8d0615da47337/add_pics_to_html_10.pl
2011-07-24 13:58:05	fsmithred	ok, it looks right now
2011-07-24 13:58:09	nadir	fsmithred, you got any clue how much "df -ahl" i can have, and still get a resulting iso fitting on a CD?
2011-07-24 13:58:31	fsmithred	no
2011-07-24 13:58:33	fsmithred	but hang on
2011-07-24 13:58:34	nadir	good.
2011-07-24 13:58:54	dbb0	https://raw.github.com/fsmithred/perl/master/add_pics_to_html_10.pl
2011-07-24 13:59:02	dbb0	that's what i was looking foor
2011-07-24 14:00:18	nadir	why not git clone?
2011-07-24 14:01:29	fsmithred	nadir, 2.1G used creates a 612M iso
2011-07-24 14:01:48	nadir	ok, thanks. So if i take 2 as a mark, i am good. thanks.
2011-07-24 14:01:53	fsmithred	that's with the latest excludes file, which leaves a bunch out
2011-07-24 14:02:04	fsmithred	all of /var/log
2011-07-24 14:02:13	nadir	yup. Always a bit annoying if it runs forever, and than i got a 701MB iso
2011-07-24 14:02:28	nadir	no biggie, but still
2011-07-24 14:02:33	dbb0	nadir: because i don't need the whole repo
2011-07-24 14:02:33	fsmithred	yeah, well you can thank dzz for some of those excludes
2011-07-24 14:02:49	nadir	well: its pretty empty. but anyway.
2011-07-24 14:03:00	dbb0	yeah i see that now
2011-07-24 14:03:00	fsmithred	just that one script now
2011-07-24 14:03:04	fsmithred	and empty README
2011-07-24 14:03:17	dbb0	lol
2011-07-24 14:03:28	nadir	ah, so a misunderstanding. I had the git clone in history, else i would have looked for the http address.
2011-07-24 14:03:34	dbb0	then why did you push it
2011-07-24 14:03:58	fsmithred	rsync still gives error message about ~/.gvfs, even though it's in the excludes file
2011-07-24 14:04:38	nadir	to hell with gvfs, i don't evne know what its good for.
2011-07-24 14:07:06	fsmithred	I'd like to know how to use public_html the right way
2011-07-24 14:07:17	fsmithred	I got as far as a2enmod userdir
2011-07-24 14:07:55	fsmithred	oh wait
2011-07-24 14:07:58	fsmithred	I think I remember something
2011-07-24 14:09:23	fsmithred	still have to make a file for the virtual host
2011-07-24 14:09:26	fsmithred	I think
2011-07-24 14:09:38		[dbb0 away: food]
2011-07-24 14:16:51	nadir	perhaps, perhaps not:
2011-07-24 14:16:55	nadir	/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
2011-07-24 14:17:25	fsmithred	if you run a2ensite some-virtual-host
2011-07-24 14:17:40	fsmithred	it puts a link in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
2011-07-24 14:17:49	fsmithred	pointing to a file in sites-available
2011-07-24 14:17:59	fsmithred	but I don't know what to put in the file in sites-available
2011-07-24 14:18:08	fsmithred	right now, only default and default-ssl
2011-07-24 14:18:49	fsmithred	I tried making one from the default
2011-07-24 14:19:02	nadir	-> ?
2011-07-24 14:19:06	nadir	        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
2011-07-24 14:19:06	nadir	        <Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
2011-07-24 14:19:06	nadir	                AllowOverride None
2011-07-24 14:19:06	nadir	                Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
2011-07-24 14:19:06	nadir	                Order allow,deny
2011-07-24 14:19:07	nadir	                Allow from all
2011-07-24 14:19:10	fsmithred	and put /home/me/public_html in the DocumentRoot line
2011-07-24 14:19:11	nadir	        </Directory>
2011-07-24 14:19:13	nadir	?
2011-07-24 14:19:27	fsmithred	then tried that in the Directory line
2011-07-24 14:19:30	nadir	above, httpd.conf, was wrong, sites enabled.
2011-07-24 14:19:33	nadir	did not work?
2011-07-24 14:19:34	fsmithred	above the part you copied
2011-07-24 14:19:40	fsmithred	didn't work
2011-07-24 14:19:46	nadir	i  had hopes that would do it. damn.
2011-07-24 14:20:08	fsmithred	I think there's a way to do it that enables all users' public_html
2011-07-24 14:20:09	nadir	i will let snapshot run and call it a day. Too little energy today.
2011-07-24 14:20:16	nadir	there must be.
2011-07-24 14:20:17	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-24 14:20:22	nadir	no, i am here.
2011-07-24 14:20:31	nadir	just saying that i can't concentrate/fiddle
2011-07-24 14:21:59	fsmithred	installing apache2-doc now
2011-07-24 14:25:11	nadir	for lighttpd i get this:
2011-07-24 14:25:27	nadir	sudo lighty-enable-mod userdir
2011-07-24 14:25:36	fsmithred	similar
2011-07-24 14:25:40	nadir	and restart the server (obviously form ubuntu documentation)
2011-07-24 14:25:44	fsmithred	a2enmod userdir
2011-07-24 14:25:56	nadir	did you restart?
2011-07-24 14:26:00	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-24 14:26:09	nadir	i hate that if it say: "la... that easy..." and nada
2011-07-24 14:26:36	nadir	ah, btw, it says you can access it via:
2011-07-24 14:26:44	nadir	http://localhost/username
2011-07-24 14:27:33	fsmithred	localhost/user/username
2011-07-24 14:27:38	fsmithred	neither works
2011-07-24 14:27:44	fsmithred	users, not user
2011-07-24 14:28:07	nadir	long story short: we need a guru.
2011-07-24 14:28:28	nadir	the apache docs is very confusing. not my thing.
2011-07-24 14:37:17	nadir	i will have a break, watch TV and all. If you hear nothing snapshto still works.
2011-07-24 14:37:38	fsmithred	http://localhost/~username
2011-07-24 14:37:46	nadir	hu?
2011-07-24 14:37:50	fsmithred	works
2011-07-24 14:37:53	nadir	with the weird?

2011-07-24 14:37:58	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-24 14:38:02	nadir	holy shit.
2011-07-24 14:38:08	nadir	anythign but obious.
2011-07-24 14:38:13	fsmithred	not sure what steps are necessary
2011-07-24 14:38:53	fsmithred	I think just a2enmod userdir
2011-07-24 14:39:02	fsmithred	and restart
2011-07-24 14:39:07	fsmithred	no virtual host
2011-07-24 14:39:12	fsmithred	no symlink in /var/www
2011-07-24 14:40:20	nadir	ok, i am done. I  soon will fall of the chair, if i don't break now.
2011-07-24 14:40:25	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-24 14:40:28	fsmithred	see you later

2011-07-25 13:32:16	dbb0	nadir: https://gist.github.com/1104650
2011-07-25 13:32:45	nadir	thanks, let me look, right now i fiddle with apache,
2011-07-25 13:32:49	nadir	does not work good.
2011-07-25 13:33:18	nadir	ah, ok. looks good.
2011-07-25 13:33:22	nadir	let me look later.
2011-07-25 13:33:31	nadir	first i would like to get the site up and running.
2011-07-25 13:33:50	dbb0	apache is a nightmare
2011-07-25 13:33:56	nadir	yes, it is.
2011-07-25 13:34:07	nadir	and if you search, you get all kind of voodoo, but not the easy things.
2011-07-25 13:37:12	nadir	what really is missing is an easy how-to for private folks, setting up an easy web-site.
2011-07-25 13:40:18	dbb0	whats the problem now
2011-07-25 13:40:52	nadir	i am trying to move all of the webite to public_html, in the users home.
2011-07-25 13:41:00	nadir	why: to avoid editing as root.
2011-07-25 13:41:11	nadir	the last thing i did, right now:
2011-07-25 13:41:27	nadir	mv /var/www /home/me/public_html
2011-07-25 13:41:44	nadir	ln -s /home/molloy/public_html/* /var/www/
2011-07-25 13:41:49	nadir	i think that worked.
2011-07-25 13:41:54	nadir	could you test?
2011-07-25 13:42:01	nadir	-> resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-25 13:50:23	dbb0	what about permissions
2011-07-25 13:50:40	nadir	well: you ask the wrong person.
2011-07-25 13:51:05	nadir	i kinda hack it together, i neither got a clue about apache, nor about anything related.
2011-07-25 13:51:23	dbb0	chmod -R aog+r ~/public_html
2011-07-25 13:51:50	dbb0	chmod -R o-w ~/public_html
2011-07-25 13:51:51	nadir	mhh... seems to work without. And i guess you mean a+r
2011-07-25 13:52:15	dbb0	yeah, i guess it includes og
2011-07-25 13:52:23	nadir	i think yes, but would not bet.
2011-07-25 13:52:37	nadir	i for one never ever need ownership or linking at all.
2011-07-25 13:52:43	nadir	now i run into it, and am a bit "baff"
2011-07-25 13:52:49	dbb0	?
2011-07-25 13:52:55	nadir	buff-> confuseled
2011-07-25 13:53:06	nadir	!tr de en baff
2011-07-25 13:53:06	@antinoos	baff
2011-07-25 13:53:10	nadir	i thought so.
2011-07-25 13:53:11	nadir	slang
2011-07-25 13:53:38	dbb0	baffled?
2011-07-25 13:53:49	nadir	lol, don't know that. let me check.
2011-07-25 13:53:58	dbb0	leo says flabbergasted
2011-07-25 13:54:04	dbb0	makes sense
2011-07-25 13:54:07	nadir	yup, exactly that: baffled
2011-07-25 13:54:32	nadir	did you check if you can open the web-site?
2011-07-25 13:54:36	nadir	pluaze!
2011-07-25 13:55:26	dbb0	what's the url
2011-07-25 13:55:39	nadir	--> resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-25 13:55:59	nadir	or you need a clickable one: http://resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-25 13:56:38	dbb0	yeah it works
2011-07-25 13:56:48	nadir	ok, so far, so good.
2011-07-25 13:56:50	nadir	thanks, btw
2011-07-25 13:57:26	dbb0	np
2011-07-25 13:57:32	dbb0	you might want to do
2011-07-25 13:57:49	dbb0	echo 'Options -Indexes' >> ~/public_html/.htaccess
2011-07-25 13:57:58	dbb0	disable directory browsing
2011-07-25 13:59:42	nadir	uhum, and yes, i want that.
2011-07-25 14:00:09	nadir	i only copy/paste your line, starting with echo, or i need more than just that?
2011-07-25 14:02:14	dbb0	just put the single-quoted string in a file called '.htaccess' in the same folder as index.html
2011-07-25 14:04:21	nadir	mhhh... that completely disables the site.
2011-07-25 14:06:58	dbb0	you didn't include the quotes, did you?
2011-07-25 14:07:28	nadir	i copied and pastet your line, starting with echo.
2011-07-25 14:07:40	nadir	molloy@backup-server:~/public_html$ cat .htaccess_backup

2011-07-25 14:08:56	nadir	yup
2011-07-25 14:09:30	dbb0	it's working for me. forced reload
2011-07-25 14:09:57	nadir	wher is your web-site, at public_html?
2011-07-25 14:10:41	dbb0	~/(domain name)
2011-07-25 14:10:54	nadir	mhhh....
2011-07-25 14:11:57	nadir	lol, now it does not disable the site anymore, but it does not disable directory browsing neither.
2011-07-25 14:12:00	nadir	what a big fuck
2011-07-25 14:12:03	nadir	apache, that is.

2011-07-25 14:46:43	nadir	to make it more easy in the header.
2011-07-25 14:46:53	fsmithred	what header?
2011-07-25 14:46:54	nadir	not important, just saying.
2011-07-25 14:47:09	nadir	for code, date, name-of-script, name of authors, like that.

2011-07-25 14:48:16	nadir	good you insisted.
2011-07-25 14:48:24	nadir	two things:
2011-07-25 14:48:38	nadir	a) i moved to public_html, but still needed linking to var/www
2011-07-25 14:48:48	fsmithred	http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pearl%20necklace
2011-07-25 14:48:50	nadir	b) did you read that my snapshot is broken again?
2011-07-25 14:49:14	nadir	aha, that i did miss too.
2011-07-25 14:49:15	fsmithred	you posted today about snapshot?
2011-07-25 14:49:21	nadir	few minutes ago.
2011-07-25 14:49:29	fsmithred	I'll look
2011-07-25 14:49:32	nadir	you don't need to look into it, or think about it for me.
2011-07-25 14:49:37	nadir	i only gave infos
2011-07-25 14:50:03	nadir	(and anything but much of infos, but i  did not do much, hence i can't give much)
2011-07-25 14:50:51	fsmithred	well, check that you're using the right excludes file and the config file
2011-07-25 14:51:00	fsmithred	is all I can think of
2011-07-25 14:51:09	nadir	i did it exactly like what i did when it worked.
2011-07-25 14:51:16	fsmithred	kernel panic could be from using initrd instead of initrd.img
2011-07-25 14:51:18	nadir	all i did was removing some gui-apps
2011-07-25 14:51:19	fsmithred	shit
2011-07-25 14:51:35	fsmithred	yeah, I see the list, and I agree that they shouldn't be a problem
2011-07-25 14:51:35	nadir	one thing which was removed, via aptitude purge ~c, was:
2011-07-25 14:51:44	nadir	librsync1
2011-07-25 14:51:49	nadir	whatever that might be.
2011-07-25 14:51:49	fsmithred	um
2011-07-25 14:51:55	nadir	a few qt-things
2011-07-25 14:51:57	fsmithred	it's got rsync in the name
2011-07-25 14:52:06	nadir	yup, thats why i made the notice.
2011-07-25 14:52:09	nadir	What i can do is:
2011-07-25 14:52:12	nadir	re-install.
2011-07-25 14:52:21	nadir	remove one app. run snapshot.
2011-07-25 14:52:27	nadir	remove the next app. run snapshot.
2011-07-25 14:52:28	nadir	and so on.
2011-07-25 14:52:37	nadir	its the best i can do, the problem is beyond me
2011-07-25 14:52:59	fsmithred	maybe start by reinstalling those apps and see if it works
2011-07-25 14:53:06	nadir	well: or that.
2011-07-25 14:53:11	nadir	god point.
2011-07-25 14:53:15	nadir	good.
2011-07-25 14:53:35	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-25 14:53:37	fsmithred	apache
2011-07-25 14:53:44	fsmithred	a2enmod userdir
2011-07-25 14:54:05	fsmithred	then go to http://localhost/~molloy
2011-07-25 14:54:09	fsmithred	should be right
2011-07-25 14:54:11	nadir	no.
2011-07-25 14:54:13	nadir	ah, yes.
2011-07-25 14:54:17	nadir	localhost does work.
2011-07-25 14:54:21	fsmithred	oh, ok
2011-07-25 14:54:22	nadir	but not the address.
2011-07-25 14:54:38	fsmithred	for the address, you have to set up port forwarding
2011-07-25 14:54:40	nadir	resident.sexbomb.com
2011-07-25 14:54:45	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 14:54:46	nadir	it is set up
2011-07-25 14:54:58	nadir	my way out was the linking.
2011-07-25 14:55:07	fsmithred	and you edited gallery.html?
2011-07-25 14:55:10	nadir	ln -s /home/me/public_html/* /var/www
2011-07-25 14:55:20	nadir	i got my whole web-site there, not only gallery.
2011-07-25 14:55:32	nadir	yup, i tried localhost, no luck.
2011-07-25 14:55:34	fsmithred	well, you might need to edit more files
2011-07-25 14:55:35	nadir	what i am not sure of:
2011-07-25 14:55:47	nadir	if i restart apache, do i need to run a2enmod userdir again?
2011-07-25 14:55:52	fsmithred	no
2011-07-25 14:56:07	fsmithred	all that does is create a symlink between sites-available and sites-enabled
2011-07-25 14:56:13	nadir	i tried:
2011-07-25 14:56:32	nadir	localhost; http://localhost; http://localhost/~me, and so on , and so on.
2011-07-25 14:56:38	nadir	My only fix was using "ln"
2011-07-25 14:57:12	fsmithred	if you want to do it as an external site, you shouldn't use localhost
2011-07-25 14:57:18	nadir	yup.
2011-07-25 14:57:23	fsmithred	every link that has localhost in it needs to be changed
2011-07-25 14:57:34	nadir	well: to what?
2011-07-25 14:57:40	fsmithred	resident
2011-07-25 14:57:42	nadir	i did: http://resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-25 14:57:51	nadir	but that did not help, until i used ln
2011-07-25 14:58:08	fsmithred	oh, actually
2011-07-25 14:58:26	fsmithred	you'd have to add /~molloy
2011-07-25 14:58:34	nadir	that too.
2011-07-25 14:58:45	nadir	i really tried all possible and impossible solutions
2011-07-25 14:59:01	fsmithred	I'll take a look, if I can get in
2011-07-25 14:59:12	nadir	yup
2011-07-25 14:59:26	nadir	whenever. Not my main problem.
2011-07-25 14:59:40	fsmithred	I'm in
2011-07-25 14:59:47	nadir	If it is up now, ok, i will work at it, until i understand apache better.
2011-07-25 15:00:00	nadir	btw: i added web4taskfer
2011-07-25 15:00:11	fsmithred	what's that?
2011-07-25 15:00:13	nadir	which i once wrote, and don't understand anymore :-)
2011-07-25 15:00:22	fsmithred	oh yeah, I remember
2011-07-25 15:00:22	nadir	docu about taskfer.
2011-07-25 15:00:36	nadir	i need to edit css, but its good to have something there.
2011-07-25 15:00:43	nadir	at least the link to your github.
2011-07-25 15:00:47	nadir	its a good tool
2011-07-25 15:02:39	fsmithred	is apache running now?
2011-07-25 15:02:46	nadir	yup
2011-07-25 15:03:32	fsmithred	ok, I can get there by the regular address
2011-07-25 15:03:34	fsmithred	no molloy
2011-07-25 15:03:54	nadir	ah, wait, i think that would have worked without linking:
2011-07-25 15:03:56	fsmithred	links work
2011-07-25 15:04:02	nadir	http://resident.la.la/~molloy
2011-07-25 15:04:05	fsmithred	yeah, it's the way it was
2011-07-25 15:04:11	nadir	but that was not what i wanted.
2011-07-25 15:04:15	fsmithred	I get nothing with ~molloy

2011-07-25 15:04:55	fsmithred	Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@localhost and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might
2011-07-25 15:05:00	nadir	yup, just checked. same here
2011-07-25 15:05:24	fsmithred	oh, maybe it says localhost there because you didn't edit the address in apache2.conf
2011-07-25 15:05:34	fsmithred	that shouldn't cause a problem unless you really want to get email
2011-07-25 15:05:45	nadir	not really.
2011-07-25 15:06:01	nadir	well: horny women, ok, but not from some butnuts
2011-07-25 15:06:09	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 15:07:07	nadir	what you said; userdir and all: all worked perfect as long i used localhost
2011-07-25 15:07:18	nadir	nice and easy, very good. I had hope.
2011-07-25 15:07:33	nadir	I went to the server, started fiddling: no luck with the "real" address
2011-07-25 15:10:10	fsmithred	omg, you symlinked all the individual files under /var/www
2011-07-25 15:10:31	nadir	it was the only solution i could find
2011-07-25 15:12:40	nadir	short side info for you:
2011-07-25 15:12:44	nadir	https://raw.github.com/gist/1104650/a4560a442ade4bf9d0ad0b6bab7230964274d165/add_pics.patch
2011-07-25 15:12:52	nadir	in case you are still at it.
2011-07-25 15:15:29	fsmithred	yeah, I'm trying stuff
2011-07-25 15:15:37	fsmithred	on my machine
2011-07-25 15:15:59	nadir	i did not look at it, he posted it short before you arrived.
2011-07-25 15:16:15	fsmithred	I did make a variable for the domain in my last one, I think
2011-07-25 15:16:23	fsmithred	called it $webhost
2011-07-25 15:16:56	fsmithred	why curly braces on that?
2011-07-25 15:17:06	fsmithred	my $url = "http://${domain}/\~$ENV{USER}/gallery";
2011-07-25 15:17:06	fsmithred	
2011-07-25 15:17:28	nadir	i think!!! curly braces is just a different way to use a var.
2011-07-25 15:17:44	nadir	especially if you do: say "this are my ${name}s
2011-07-25 15:17:54	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-25 15:17:59	nadir	if you want to add a symbol _after the var itself.
2011-07-25 15:18:18	nadir	ah, oh, or you mean ENV? If so:no idea, it simply is that way.
2011-07-25 15:18:29	fsmithred	whose notes are these on the diff?
2011-07-25 15:18:37	nadir	all of that is by dbb0
2011-07-25 15:18:41	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-25 15:18:51	fsmithred	just so you know...
2011-07-25 15:19:09	fsmithred	I put $work_dir in the path because I was using full paths on everything
2011-07-25 15:19:42	nadir	ok.
2011-07-25 15:20:38	nadir	my question bout the gang-name means that i got problems to put my name at the top of this one,
2011-07-25 15:20:46	nadir	as all i did was running around and asking.
2011-07-25 15:24:31	fsmithred	you're using port 80?
2011-07-25 15:24:40	nadir	yes.
2011-07-25 15:24:40	fsmithred	or non-standard port?
2011-07-25 15:24:45	fsmithred	externally, I mean
2011-07-25 15:24:48	fsmithred	oh wait
2011-07-25 15:24:49	nadir	yes
2011-07-25 15:24:52	nadir	me too
2011-07-25 15:24:56	fsmithred	obviously, 80, because I can connect
2011-07-25 15:25:02	nadir	:-)
2011-07-25 15:25:23	fsmithred	ok, I made a new user
2011-07-25 15:25:38	fsmithred	new user made ~/public_html
2011-07-25 15:25:47	fsmithred	touch public_html/testfile
2011-07-25 15:26:09	fsmithred	I go to http://IP number:port/~phred
2011-07-25 15:26:17	fsmithred	and I see testfile
2011-07-25 15:26:27	fsmithred	Index of /~phred
2011-07-25 15:26:39	fsmithred	I didn't have to change anything for that
2011-07-25 15:26:42	nadir	mhh... you mean adding :80
2011-07-25 15:26:55	fsmithred	not 80
2011-07-25 15:27:00	fsmithred	using 7878
2011-07-25 15:27:03	nadir	i mean me, not you.
2011-07-25 15:27:13	fsmithred	you shouldn't need to add the port
2011-07-25 15:27:15	nadir	cause for me, without :port, it does not work
2011-07-25 15:27:16	fsmithred	80 is the default
2011-07-25 15:28:00	fsmithred	adding port for molloy doesn't help
2011-07-25 15:29:24	fsmithred	anyway
2011-07-25 15:29:32	fsmithred	my apache config files are all default
2011-07-25 15:29:59	nadir	not all of mine are, that might be the problem.
2011-07-25 15:30:10	nadir	please don't ask what exactly.
2011-07-25 15:35:14	fsmithred	I think most of your files have same dates as mine
2011-07-25 15:35:16	fsmithred	well
2011-07-25 15:35:27	fsmithred	apache2.conf you edited on jun 19

2011-07-25 15:39:40	nadir	just kidding: in which file is it?

2011-07-25 15:40:01	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-25 15:40:09	fsmithred	mkt
2011-07-25 15:40:19	nadir	setting to 500 is from debian.wiki
2011-07-25 15:40:39	nadir	and var/www/music was to get it "restricted" -> with password.
2011-07-25 15:40:39	fsmithred	you are > and +
2011-07-25 15:40:44	nadir	all as far i know
2011-07-25 15:40:50	fsmithred	yeah, that appears to work
2011-07-25 15:40:54	fsmithred	or at least it asks
2011-07-25 15:41:12	fsmithred	I hit on that link once today, because it was in the drop-down menu in ff
2011-07-25 15:41:27	nadir	and, found some stuff?
2011-07-25 15:41:35	fsmithred	just got a login request
2011-07-25 15:41:44	fsmithred	I can log in?
2011-07-25 15:41:52	nadir	primus forU2hear
2011-07-25 15:41:54	fsmithred	I don't remember what you did with that
2011-07-25 15:41:56	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-25 15:42:09	nadir	perhaps make a note in your home
2011-07-25 15:42:35	nadir	earier i tried to figure out if one can download a whole dir with downloadhelper, but could not solve it.
2011-07-25 15:42:50	fsmithred	yeah, it works
2011-07-25 15:42:52	nadir	what would be good too is pointing a whole dir to, say, vlc
2011-07-25 15:43:15	nadir	I for one hate to click on one song after the other (hence am not a big fan of youtube)
2011-07-25 15:43:34	nadir	well: or get the head into ampache
2011-07-25 15:44:23	fsmithred	ah, ff will remember for me
2011-07-25 15:45:04	nadir	in the days when i was young fff meant: ficken, fressen, fernsehen, which means: fuck, eat and TV
2011-07-25 15:45:21	nadir	for dumb persons. So each time i read ff, i am shocked at first glance
2011-07-25 15:47:59	nadir	telemachus and i talked about setting up a git-repo.
2011-07-25 15:47:59	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 15:48:09	nadir	yeah, but imagine how it feels for me.
2011-07-25 15:48:15	nadir	a git repo might be interesting.
2011-07-25 15:48:21	fsmithred	yikes
2011-07-25 15:48:26	fsmithred	I can barely use git
2011-07-25 15:48:29	nadir	say, mhhh.... well...
2011-07-25 15:48:38	nadir	at github i store coding.
2011-07-25 15:48:46	nadir	but say i want to share or sync pictures.
2011-07-25 15:48:53	nadir	or stuff like that, non-coding.
2011-07-25 15:49:11	nadir	i use git to keep stuff in sync between laptop and PC
2011-07-25 15:49:16	nadir	well: i try.
2011-07-25 15:49:29	nadir	i can't say i understand it yet.
2011-07-25 15:49:42	fsmithred	put it on your server?
2011-07-25 15:49:48	nadir	yes, like that.
2011-07-25 15:50:04	nadir	for you it would not change. The logs are here, and my idea is to keep the logs.
2011-07-25 15:50:07	fsmithred	would be good experience
2011-07-25 15:50:12	nadir	to get rid of the cloud, so to speak
2011-07-25 15:50:36	nadir	not sure if i would trust me more than, say, google
2011-07-25 15:50:59	fsmithred	well, I trust you not to sell any data
2011-07-25 15:51:06	nadir	like said: you can do there, on the server, all that you want, in case you got ideas
2011-07-25 15:51:10	nadir	(i for one had none)
2011-07-25 15:51:21	nadir	seriously: i would not even find any logs
2011-07-25 15:51:23	nadir	lol
2011-07-25 15:51:38	nadir	even if i wanted i could not do it.
2011-07-25 15:51:56	fsmithred	http://68.187.226.52:7878/~avedis/gallery/gallery.html
2011-07-25 15:52:02	nadir	but still: my general idea is that each user does it himself (with the own server, or sheevplug, or however)
2011-07-25 15:52:03	fsmithred	check out the first two pics
2011-07-25 15:52:24	fsmithred	Land O' Lakes butter package
2011-07-25 15:53:17	nadir	ah, wait, nadir, stay cool... first things first:
2011-07-25 15:53:23	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 15:53:26	nadir	whats the deal with Land O'lake?
2011-07-25 15:53:29	fsmithred	those are her knees
2011-07-25 15:53:51	fsmithred	you fold the package back and cut out three edges of the butter box that she's holding
2011-07-25 15:53:58	fsmithred	so it opens
2011-07-25 15:54:00	nadir	ah, got it now
2011-07-25 15:54:01	fsmithred	to show...
2011-07-25 15:54:05	nadir	yup, funny.
2011-07-25 15:54:13	fsmithred	no idea who thought up that one
2011-07-25 15:54:18	nadir	nice picture. LIke an avatar or so: not bad.
2011-07-25 15:54:34	nadir	ok, now my sudden enlightenment:
2011-07-25 15:54:40	fsmithred	oh, that would make a great avatar
2011-07-25 15:54:52	nadir	canci told me how to convert disregarding aspect ratio:
2011-07-25 15:55:00	nadir	just add a ! after 145x145!
2011-07-25 15:55:09	nadir	got me?
2011-07-25 15:55:12	fsmithred	no
2011-07-25 15:55:16	fsmithred	what's it do?
2011-07-25 15:55:16	nadir	fuck.
2011-07-25 15:55:23	nadir	look at my galery.
2011-07-25 15:55:56	nadir	all thumbnails are of the same size.
2011-07-25 15:56:02	fsmithred	how?
2011-07-25 15:56:04	nadir	in my eyes that looks better.
2011-07-25 15:56:09	fsmithred	how do I get there?
2011-07-25 15:56:10	nadir	what?
2011-07-25 15:56:23	fsmithred	got it
2011-07-25 15:56:27	nadir	ah, ok
2011-07-25 15:56:33	nadir	if you look at fire.png
2011-07-25 15:56:55	nadir	it has a different size. That is not what i want, and i don't know why it is like that.
2011-07-25 15:56:55	fsmithred	I'm gonna try it
2011-07-25 15:57:05	nadir	but in general all are of the same size
2011-07-25 15:57:19	fsmithred	maybe it's smaller than 145 to begin with?
2011-07-25 15:57:30	nadir	yup, might well be.
2011-07-25 15:57:48	nadir	i used cancis script here, locally, and moved all of that to the server.
2011-07-25 15:57:57	nadir	not sure what happened when, what i did, and so on.
2011-07-25 15:58:36	nadir	you know the css stuff to change background color, or you like the white background?
2011-07-25 15:59:08	fsmithred	I've changed backgrounds in the past with kompozer
2011-07-25 15:59:14	fsmithred	don't know the code
2011-07-25 15:59:22	nadir	body {
2011-07-25 15:59:22	nadir	            margin:  30px 100px 20px 60px ;
2011-07-25 15:59:22	nadir	            background:   #a3a3a3;
2011-07-25 15:59:22	nadir	}
2011-07-25 15:59:25	nadir	thats all.
2011-07-25 15:59:29	fsmithred	and my thumbs didn't change
2011-07-25 15:59:36	nadir	say your top dir is la.html .
2011-07-25 15:59:39	nadir	mkdir css
2011-07-25 15:59:41	fsmithred	what about background image?
2011-07-25 15:59:49	nadir	not sure how that would work.
2011-07-25 15:59:56	nadir	I tried, it was not too hard.
2011-07-25 15:59:59	nadir	i forgot it.
2011-07-25 16:00:21	nadir	        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/screen-index.css">
2011-07-25 16:00:28	nadir	that you put in the index.html
2011-07-25 16:00:34	nadir	or whatever name the html has got.
2011-07-25 16:00:41	nadir	ready to run. Check for colors, done
2011-07-25 16:01:14	fsmithred	oh, duh
2011-07-25 16:01:30	fsmithred	my thumbs didn't change because I wrote the script not to convert if the thumbs exist
2011-07-25 16:01:35	fsmithred	I have to delete them
2011-07-25 16:01:38	nadir	ah.
2011-07-25 16:02:00	nadir	what would be cool is to add something which says:
2011-07-25 16:02:09	nadir	add five pics per line, than make a new line.
2011-07-25 16:02:14	nadir	or six pics, or four.
2011-07-25 16:02:24	nadir	but not now, and not me.
2011-07-25 16:03:03	fsmithred	ok, it works
2011-07-25 16:03:07	fsmithred	they're all the same size now
2011-07-25 16:03:11	nadir	cool.
2011-07-25 16:03:20	nadir	i like that much better.
2011-07-25 16:03:27	fsmithred	distorted a bit
2011-07-25 16:03:32	nadir	yup.
2011-07-25 16:03:36	fsmithred	maybe make them a little smaller
2011-07-25 16:03:47	nadir	but its only an overview. If yo want to look at a pic, click.
2011-07-25 16:03:51	fsmithred	yeah,
2011-07-25 16:03:53	nadir	thats how i use it.
2011-07-25 16:03:59	fsmithred	I say smaller so you can't really see what's there
2011-07-25 16:04:05	nadir	got you.
2011-07-25 16:04:06	fsmithred	just enough to know which pic it is
2011-07-25 16:04:18	nadir	a background would really be nice, once you said it.
2011-07-25 16:04:23	nadir	instead of a color
2011-07-25 16:04:45	fsmithred	you can use a small image and make it a repeating pattern
2011-07-25 16:04:54	fsmithred	for a textured background
2011-07-25 16:07:02	nadir	i don'T think i understood that.
2011-07-25 16:07:53	fsmithred	hm
2011-07-25 16:08:06	fsmithred	hang on
2011-07-25 16:08:10	nadir	yup
2011-07-25 16:10:00	fsmithred	go back to my page
2011-07-25 16:10:07	fsmithred	look at backgrounds
2011-07-25 16:10:10	fsmithred	last folder
2011-07-25 16:10:28	fsmithred	that's the background image for geneweb
2011-07-25 16:10:31	nadir	ok
2011-07-25 16:10:37	fsmithred	it's small, and it gets repeated
2011-07-25 16:10:38	fsmithred	tiled
2011-07-25 16:10:45	nadir	wait, for who? genewb?
2011-07-25 16:10:48	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-25 16:11:06	nadir	never heard that (no miracle)
2011-07-25 16:11:16	nadir	ok,and now?
2011-07-25 16:11:17	fsmithred	it's genealogy software
2011-07-25 16:11:33	nadir	ah, ok, found it.
2011-07-25 16:11:43	fsmithred	I don't know the html code
2011-07-25 16:11:49	fsmithred	might be able to find it
2011-07-25 16:11:51	fsmithred	but anyway
2011-07-25 16:12:03	fsmithred	that's one way to handle the background
2011-07-25 16:12:11	fsmithred	instead of one big image
2011-07-25 16:12:16	nadir	ok, but how do you insert it to a web-page?
2011-07-25 16:12:36	fsmithred	with the proper html code
2011-07-25 16:12:39	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 16:12:39	nadir	you got an index.html, and want your geneweb generated thing to be..
2011-07-25 16:12:46	nadir	integrated. how?
2011-07-25 16:12:49	fsmithred	it's built into the program
2011-07-25 16:12:57	nadir	inside of index.html. ah,
2011-07-25 16:12:57	fsmithred	hang on
2011-07-25 16:13:54	nadir	something like what you posted sure would be a good background, btw
2011-07-25 16:19:19	fsmithred	ok. look in my home for geneweb.tar.gz
2011-07-25 16:19:25	fsmithred	I saved a complete web page
2011-07-25 16:19:36	nadir	ok.
2011-07-25 16:19:52	nadir	/home/you/geneweb.tar.gz?
2011-07-25 16:20:01	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-25 16:20:03	nadir	so i can rsync, without ssh-ing first.
2011-07-25 16:20:16	nadir	oh, no. i need to move it to my home first. ok, gimme a sec.
2011-07-25 16:20:17	fsmithred	I'm on backup-server
2011-07-25 16:20:34	fsmithred	I'm gonna slip out for a quick smoke
2011-07-25 16:21:23	nadir	ok.
2011-07-25 16:22:44	nadir	the resuling background would be of my liking
2011-07-25 16:22:57	nadir	perhaps a bit darker, but in general: very good
2011-07-25 16:27:27	fsmithred	back
2011-07-25 16:27:31	fsmithred	yeah, you could change it
2011-07-25 16:27:37	fsmithred	or use something else entirely
2011-07-25 16:27:58	fsmithred	I got one I used on another page
2011-07-25 16:28:12	fsmithred	took a photo of an old book cover
2011-07-25 16:28:16	fsmithred	made it lighter
2011-07-25 16:28:29	fsmithred	it's a coarse cloth cover
2011-07-25 16:28:36	fsmithred	hang on, and I'll add it
2011-07-25 16:30:08	fsmithred	damn, I like this script
2011-07-25 16:30:13	fsmithred	they're up
2011-07-25 16:30:45	fsmithred	I think the one called 'paper' is from kde desktop backgrounds
2011-07-25 16:31:04	nadir	perhaps from the backgrounds for konqueror.
2011-07-25 16:31:10	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-25 16:31:15	nadir	there were some, one could play with, ircc
2011-07-25 16:31:24	fsmithred	I'm sure you're right
2011-07-25 16:31:27	fsmithred	I remember it
2011-07-25 16:31:36	nadir	i think i know it, thats for sure.
2011-07-25 16:31:42	fsmithred	there was a gray background for the desktop I liked, too
2011-07-25 16:31:59	nadir	while you smoked i installed kompozer.
2011-07-25 16:32:05	nadir	holy shit. that _is_ confusing.
2011-07-25 16:32:19	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 16:32:29	fsmithred	pretend it's a text editor
2011-07-25 16:32:31	fsmithred	mostly
2011-07-25 16:32:36	nadir	i willl keep it in mind as a long-time project.
2011-07-25 16:33:04	fsmithred	tabs at the bottom of the edit window show different views
2011-07-25 16:33:21	fsmithred	view the code, view what it looks like, and something else
2011-07-25 16:33:34	fsmithred	it = the page
2011-07-25 16:34:16	nadir	i think something else is split between both.
2011-07-25 16:35:03	fsmithred	the kde paper also comes in yellow
2011-07-25 16:35:06	fsmithred	I just found it
2011-07-25 16:35:33	nadir	uhum. My main concern is to be easy on the eyes.
2011-07-25 16:35:45	nadir	white is nearly the worst.
2011-07-25 16:35:47	nadir	:-)
2011-07-25 16:38:32	fsmithred	yeah, it's harsh
2011-07-25 16:39:00	nadir	wherever possible i change it.
2011-07-25 16:39:15	nadir	here, xchat, i would not know how.
2011-07-25 16:39:20	nadir	beige is ok, i think
2011-07-25 16:39:26	nadir	!tr de en beige
2011-07-25 16:39:26	@antinoos	beige
2011-07-25 16:39:28	nadir	ok
2011-07-25 16:41:14	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-25 16:41:28	fsmithred	I just added paper1 background to my gallery.html
2011-07-25 16:41:52	fsmithred	looks like it's too small and starts to repeat near the right edge
2011-07-25 16:42:41	nadir	ah, yes, might be that was why i gave up on it.
2011-07-25 16:43:00	fsmithred	just changed it to the book cover
2011-07-25 16:43:12	fsmithred	that one fits
2011-07-25 16:43:32	fsmithred	if you want to see the code, I'll transfer the file for you
2011-07-25 16:43:45	nadir	nah, not now. thanks. looks good
2011-07-25 16:44:07	fsmithred	done
2011-07-25 16:44:10	fsmithred	gallery.html
2011-07-25 16:45:44	nadir	can't i simply see the code in iceweasel/view code?
2011-07-25 16:46:29	fsmithred	<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../css/screen-index.css"></head><body style="background-image: url(pictures/backgrounds/cover.jpg);">
2011-07-25 16:46:38	fsmithred	yeah, you can do it that way
2011-07-25 16:46:48	fsmithred	but I'm not going to leave the site up
2011-07-25 16:46:55	nadir	yup, that i saw, and i figured it was what i would need -> url(...
2011-07-25 16:47:00	nadir	ah, ok
2011-07-25 16:47:09	nadir	If we figure out you can host it here.
2011-07-25 16:47:15	nadir	not that site, any site.
2011-07-25 16:47:36	fsmithred	If I figure out a need for a website
2011-07-25 16:47:44	nadir	yup, thought so.
2011-07-25 16:47:56	nadir	say: storing mini-how-tos is not bad.
2011-07-25 16:48:01	nadir	i got my bookmarks there.
2011-07-25 16:48:03	fsmithred	true
2011-07-25 16:48:20	nadir	wherever i am, i opne it, download the bookmarks, and got them in sync,
2011-07-25 16:48:27	nadir	not the best solution, but it works
2011-07-25 16:48:43	nadir	ok: it kinda works.
2011-07-25 16:49:36	nadir	did you look at sparkleshare?
2011-07-25 16:49:50	nadir	i don't say its great, but it might be an idea.
2011-07-25 16:50:16	fsmithred	nope
2011-07-25 16:50:18	fsmithred	what is it?
2011-07-25 16:50:40	nadir	good question. It is said to replace dropbox, the freedomboxers propose it at their site.
2011-07-25 16:50:50	nadir	it is kind of a backend for dropbox
2011-07-25 16:51:12	nadir	The good thing, for some: you get around all the git-commands.
2011-07-25 16:51:28	nadir	you got your systray, it sits there, and you do the copy/paste thing.
2011-07-25 16:51:38	nadir	RAM-hog, sure.
2011-07-25 16:51:55	nadir	and it fails with huge repos, at least for me.
2011-07-25 16:52:31	nadir	26MB is the web-site, and it makes sparkleshare crash
2011-07-25 16:52:40	nadir	not that huge.
2011-07-25 16:54:23	fsmithred	ok, I just added that html line to the header part of the script
2011-07-25 16:54:28	fsmithred	replaced the line that was there
2011-07-25 16:54:36	fsmithred	and made the image url a variable
2011-07-25 16:54:38	fsmithred	it works
2011-07-25 16:55:04	nadir	yup, its easy to change things inside of it. That is what i like.
2011-07-25 16:59:58	fsmithred	what's asunder?
2011-07-25 17:00:04	fsmithred	cd ripper?
2011-07-25 17:00:11	nadir	lol. yes.
2011-07-25 17:00:18	fsmithred	yeah, I know...
2011-07-25 17:00:20	nadir	well: i hope. i usually remove it.
2011-07-25 17:00:22	fsmithred	I put it there
2011-07-25 17:00:38	nadir	no need for a ripper on a live-CD.
2011-07-25 17:00:47	nadir	i think i use abcde
2011-07-25 17:01:07	fsmithred	well, I was thinking in terms of installing a complete desktop
2011-07-25 17:01:22	nadir	yeah, sure.
2011-07-25 17:01:26	fsmithred	one of the hardest things for people trying linux is to know what apps to use
2011-07-25 17:01:38	fsmithred	at least if they're installed, there's a chance of finding them
2011-07-25 17:01:44	nadir	yup. and i for one know a very, very tiny part of Debian-apps
2011-07-25 17:02:00	nadir	exactly. Once they are there, on has got the idea.
2011-07-25 17:02:09	nadir	but "rosetti" sure is a sucker.
2011-07-25 17:02:12	nadir	if you ask me.
2011-07-25 17:02:18	fsmithred	ristretto?
2011-07-25 17:02:21	nadir	yup.
2011-07-25 17:02:24	fsmithred	I hate it
2011-07-25 17:02:27	nadir	yup
2011-07-25 17:02:33	nadir	geeqie seems ok.
2011-07-25 17:02:45	fsmithred	I installed gthumb on my main machine
2011-07-25 17:02:46	nadir	gthumb is a bit heavy, but not bad,
2011-07-25 17:02:47	fsmithred	and it won't work
2011-07-25 17:02:53	fsmithred	so I removed it
2011-07-25 17:02:54	nadir	what? sucker
2011-07-25 17:02:59	fsmithred	tried something else, didn't like it
2011-07-25 17:03:05	fsmithred	settled on geeqie
2011-07-25 17:03:17	fsmithred	but if I recall correctly, and unless they fixed it
2011-07-25 17:03:21	fsmithred	it prints poorly
2011-07-25 17:03:46	nadir	ah, i see.
2011-07-25 17:05:15	fsmithred	I'm trying it now
2011-07-25 17:09:03	fsmithred	well, I picked a poor copy to begin with
2011-07-25 17:09:09	fsmithred	I think gimp looks a little better
2011-07-25 17:09:22	fsmithred	need to try a different image
2011-07-25 17:16:52	fsmithred	ok, tests done
2011-07-25 17:17:00	fsmithred	gimp looks better, but they all look bad
2011-07-25 17:17:10	fsmithred	I think I need a new toner cartridge
2011-07-25 17:17:32	nadir	ah, i ain't got a printer at all. and don't need one.
2011-07-25 17:18:12	fsmithred	I should probably test it with someone's color printer
2011-07-25 17:18:27	fsmithred	and test something like a map
2011-07-25 17:21:09	fsmithred	did you look at my perl repo today?
2011-07-25 17:21:20	nadir	no. sorry.
2011-07-25 17:21:22	fsmithred	I added a few variants
2011-07-25 17:21:38	fsmithred	dbb suggested File::?
2011-07-25 17:21:41	fsmithred	I forget now
2011-07-25 17:21:53	fsmithred	File::Path
2011-07-25 17:21:57	nadir	probably Copy
2011-07-25 17:22:00	fsmithred	so I did one with that
2011-07-25 17:22:03	nadir	wait, let me look.
2011-07-25 17:22:09	fsmithred	we're already using File::Copy
2011-07-25 17:22:17	fsmithred	another uses File::Basename
2011-07-25 17:22:25	fsmithred	which acts like basename in bash
2011-07-25 17:22:27	nadir	yeah, figured out after i hit enter.
2011-07-25 17:22:42	fsmithred	and I tried using map like Tele suggested
2011-07-25 17:22:45	fsmithred	that was a disaster
2011-07-25 17:22:49	fsmithred	but it's up there anyway
2011-07-25 17:22:53	nadir	you were right, file path.
2011-07-25 17:23:08	nadir	map looks like chinese to me.
2011-07-25 17:23:20	nadir	i am more concerned abuot apache and such, atm.
2011-07-25 17:23:25	nadir	perl has to wait a bit.
2011-07-25 17:23:49	fsmithred	some dialect of chinese that I don't know
2011-07-25 17:23:56	nadir	perhaps i will try later to look into opendir (which i said like 10 times already)
2011-07-25 17:23:59	fsmithred	yeah, your apache is being a pain
2011-07-25 17:24:05	nadir	yup.
2011-07-25 17:24:14	nadir	and i got problems to keep all my stuff in sync.
2011-07-25 17:24:22	nadir	i never know exactly where i am.
2011-07-25 17:24:34	nadir	my lack of git knowledge does not make it better.
2011-07-25 17:24:56	nadir	for now i think i am done, so i can go back
2011-07-25 17:24:58	nadir	to perl
2011-07-25 17:25:12	nadir	(though i would really love to fiddle with blosxom, and its perl too)
2011-07-25 17:25:31	nadir	a blog, for the purpose to save notes, like mini how-tos
2011-07-25 17:25:53	nadir	for my day-to-day activities and such i don't need a blog.
2011-07-25 17:25:58	nadir	more a "reminder"
2011-07-25 17:26:06	nadir	I abuse forums for that, righ now
2011-07-25 17:26:08	fsmithred	hosted on backup-server?
2011-07-25 17:26:14	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-25 17:26:27	nadir	i think there is already a dir and all.
2011-07-25 17:26:30	nadir	its just empty.
2011-07-25 17:26:49	nadir	ssh-commands, git commands, such things
2011-07-25 17:27:08	nadir	ah, my new toy: debootstrap with xnest, now that is fun.
2011-07-25 17:27:16	nadir	but i sure can'T remember the commands.
2011-07-25 17:27:45	nadir	and inbetween i fiddle with hurd and refractasnapshot....
2011-07-25 17:27:52	nadir	well: and i chat.
2011-07-25 17:28:09	nadir	.
2011-07-25 17:28:19	nadir	thing is: i am very interested in the freedombox.
2011-07-25 17:28:35	nadir	another reason to try such things.
2011-07-25 17:31:50	fsmithred	ok, I installed blosxom
2011-07-25 17:31:57	fsmithred	read the README in docs
2011-07-25 17:31:57	nadir	uff.
2011-07-25 17:32:09	fsmithred	read the README.Debian in docs
2011-07-25 17:32:15	fsmithred	now what?
2011-07-25 17:32:45	nadir	lol.
2011-07-25 17:32:51	nadir	you need to... mhhh...
2011-07-25 17:32:55	nadir	you need to link to it.
2011-07-25 17:33:28	nadir	but blosxom is very uncomfortable, you first need to configure it.
2011-07-25 17:34:34	nadir	i had a bookmark, online how-to, but can't find it.
2011-07-25 17:35:25	fsmithred	ok, I followed the instructions in the man page for creating a first post, and I can't save it.
2011-07-25 17:35:29	fsmithred	Don't have permission.
2011-07-25 17:36:12	nadir	it might be that is where my CGI entry came from.
2011-07-25 17:36:46	nadir	i think that is what i used
2011-07-25 17:36:50	nadir	http://blosxom.com/documentation/users/install/dynamic/isp.html
2011-07-25 17:36:58	nadir	and: i think it did not work :-)
2011-07-25 17:40:34	nadir	i got to eat. i think
2011-07-25 17:42:00	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-25 17:42:08	nadir	see us later.
2011-07-25 17:42:18	fsmithred	bye

2011-07-25 20:09:10	dbb0	that was some meal
2011-07-25 20:11:45	nadir	i can'T set pidgin to bounce when someon postst.
2011-07-25 20:11:55	nadir	a bit at a loss right now.
2011-07-25 20:12:06	nadir	if i don't answer: you know the reason.
2011-07-25 20:12:11	dbb0	pidgin's a pretty terrible irc client
2011-07-25 20:12:17	nadir	oh my.
2011-07-25 20:12:40	nadir	kelsoo gave me the business cause of license, now you give me the business cause of pidgin
2011-07-25 20:13:29	dbb0	hey, i really don't care what you use
2011-07-25 20:14:00	nadir	just kidding. i am rather happy with xchat, but try a bit.
2011-07-25 20:14:16	nadir	like always i am bad with new stuff
2011-07-25 20:14:54	nadir	fiddled a bit with blosxom, blog thing, the last few hours. did not get far, but i think i will use it.
2011-07-25 20:15:45	dbb0	i noticed the heredocs contained </br> elements
2011-07-25 20:16:22	dbb0	should be <br /> since it's a single element
2011-07-25 20:16:32	dbb0	like <img />
2011-07-25 20:16:50	dbb0	unlike <p></p> or <head></head>
2011-07-25 20:17:25	nadir	yup, i always mix that.
2011-07-25 20:18:01	nadir	i assumed something was wrong, but could not figure out what.
2011-07-25 20:20:39	dbb0	you can also use <br> but the xml gods will shoot lightning bolts at you
2011-07-25 20:21:10	nadir	lol
2011-07-25 20:21:19	nadir	so -> <br/>, yes?
2011-07-25 20:21:35	nadir	cause / and \ is the other thing which confuses me
2011-07-25 20:22:30	dbb0	<br /> is the "correct" version in strict xhtml
2011-07-25 20:22:41	dbb0	<br> and <br/> will work
2011-07-25 20:23:05	nadir	holy crap, a space too. wtf.
2011-07-25 20:23:13	dbb0	it's always a forward slash to close an element
2011-07-25 20:29:26	dbb0	actually
2011-07-25 20:29:39	dbb0	<br/> is not an error in xhtml strict
2011-07-25 20:29:52	nadir	thanks god. a little relief
2011-07-25 20:30:58	dbb0	however, a line break must be inside a p, h1..6, div, pre, address, fieldset, ins, or del
2011-07-25 20:31:20	dbb0	so '<p>some text</p><br />' is an error
2011-07-25 20:32:05	nadir	if i am not wrong telemachus considers the complete usage of <br/> as an error.
2011-07-25 20:32:19	nadir	while, at the same time saying: breaking lines is not easy.
2011-07-25 20:32:21	nadir	umfp
2011-07-25 20:32:26	dbb0	yeah, probably
2011-07-25 20:32:38	dbb0	he also hates xhtml
2011-07-25 20:33:19	nadir	i will try to change what you said as soon as possible, but it might be once i am at it i don't know what/how anymore
2011-07-25 20:33:29	nadir	all, i said all, books do it different
2011-07-25 20:33:50	nadir	and i sure don't do much
2011-07-25 20:35:04	dbb0	all books do what different
2011-07-25 20:35:29	nadir	everyhing html
2011-07-25 20:36:25	nadir	not saying its good books, but its the one available for me (via library)
2011-07-25 20:36:33	nadir	buying one good one would be the easy solution.
2011-07-25 20:37:09	nadir	well: the main deal is that most do the css stuff inside of html
2011-07-25 20:37:30	dbb0	i like using an external css file
2011-07-25 20:37:58	dbb0	w3schools has some good/basic/free tutorials
2011-07-25 20:38:07	dbb0	html, js, css, xml
2011-07-25 20:38:21	nadir	is that  the *dog* sites?
2011-07-25 20:38:41	dbb0	?
2011-07-25 20:38:56	dbb0	http://w3schools.com
2011-07-25 20:39:38	nadir	the dog: http://htmldog.com/
2011-07-25 20:39:47	nadir	thanks for the  link, will bookmark
2011-07-25 20:41:58	dbb0	np
2011-07-25 20:44:57	dbb0	do you always stay up this late
2011-07-25 20:45:09	nadir	it always changes.
2011-07-25 20:45:32	nadir	each day i go to bed two hours later than the day before. To give the idea
2011-07-25 20:45:53	dbb0	that happens to me a lot
2011-07-25 20:46:00	nadir	today i went to bed at 8:00 am, so this morning i will probably go to sleep at  10:00 am
2011-07-25 20:46:03	nadir	and so forth
2011-07-25 20:46:11	dbb0	circadian rhythm
2011-07-25 20:46:18	nadir	yup.
2011-07-25 20:46:40	nadir	but in general i prefer the night.
2011-07-25 20:47:03	nadir	i think i correctet the br-error.
2011-07-25 20:52:25	dbb0	:%s/<\/br>/<br\ \/>/g
2011-07-25 20:54:05	nadir	ah,yup. but it have only been four errors i think
2011-07-25 20:55:42	dbb0	?
2011-07-25 20:57:01	nadir	your replacement would replace all at once, i did it manually, but it has been inside the script four times, so it was not too hard.
2011-07-25 20:57:09	dbb0	ah
2011-07-25 20:59:18	nadir	i had a line like this:
2011-07-25 20:59:30	nadir	href="./content/soso"
2011-07-25 20:59:43	nadir	i wanted to replace ->
2011-07-25 20:59:44	nadir	./#
2011-07-25 20:59:48	nadir	damn:
2011-07-25 20:59:50	nadir	./
2011-07-25 20:59:51	nadir	with
2011-07-25 20:59:58	nadir	http://localhost
2011-07-25 21:00:04	nadir	that did not work
2011-07-25 21:00:21	nadir	with :%s, is what i mean
2011-07-25 21:01:37	nadir	i tried to escape the dot, and to not escape it.
2011-07-25 21:02:41	dbb0	%s/.\//http:\/\/localhost/
2011-07-25 21:03:10	dbb0	wait, you do want to escape the dot
2011-07-25 21:03:15	dbb0	%s/\.\//http:\/\/localhost/
2011-07-25 21:03:50	dbb0	if it's just one line then replace % with the line number
2011-07-25 21:04:06	nadir	i am quite sure that is what i did, but the result was very strange.
2011-07-25 21:04:19	nadir	everything after teh replacement was double.
2011-07-25 21:04:35	dbb0	because . is any character except newline
2011-07-25 21:04:52	dbb0	so .\/ matches // and :/
2011-07-25 21:05:23	dbb0	better yet, include the opening quote in the pattern
2011-07-25 21:05:42	nadir	that might have been an idea.
2011-07-25 21:06:02	nadir	i can do easy replacements, but such thing are too hard.
2011-07-25 21:07:00	dbb0	:1s/"\.\//"http:\/\/localhost/
2011-07-25 21:07:39	nadir	let me try to find a file where i got that.
2011-07-25 21:07:55	dbb0	just make one
2011-07-25 21:08:35	dbb0	include something like $foo = "http://bar/"; that you don't want to replace
2011-07-25 21:08:46	dbb0	to make sure that you only hit the target pattern
2011-07-25 21:09:24	nadir	yup, seems to work
2011-07-25 21:09:30	nadir	including the qoute
2011-07-25 21:09:35	nadir	quote
2011-07-25 21:10:00	nadir	but i think i got your general idea too
2011-07-25 21:11:00	dbb0	if you have a lot of forward slashes, you can do
2011-07-25 21:11:18	dbb0	:s#\./#http://foo#
2011-07-25 21:11:24	dbb0	or whatever
2011-07-25 21:12:39	nadir	you sure?
2011-07-25 21:12:48	nadir	i know it works elsewhere, but in vim too?
2011-07-25 21:13:02	nadir	if yes: cool
2011-07-25 21:13:16	dbb0	in perl you can do s{foo}{bar} but not vim
2011-07-25 21:13:31	dbb0	in vim the delimiter has to be a single char
2011-07-25 21:13:51	dbb0	i usually use / # %
2011-07-25 21:16:53	nadir	i will have a break. enough for one day. later

2011-07-27 10:35:13	fsmithred	you looked at my blog in the last couple of hours?
2011-07-27 10:35:35	nadir	i just awoke, one sec ago, booted PC, and saw your email. will look now
2011-07-27 10:35:56	nadir	firs i wanted to come here, to see if you are still around
2011-07-27 10:36:03	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-27 10:37:06	nadir	ok, i see it now. nice
2011-07-27 10:37:22	fsmithred	I'm starting to understand blosxom
2011-07-27 10:37:25	fsmithred	a little
2011-07-27 10:37:32	nadir	similar it was for me, at non public pc's. but, like said, no luck at the server.
2011-07-27 10:37:51	fsmithred	you still have all files symlinked in /var/www?
2011-07-27 10:38:06	nadir	yes.
2011-07-27 10:38:21	fsmithred	I think you should do it differently
2011-07-27 10:38:33	fsmithred	just make a symklink for molloy/
2011-07-27 10:38:35	nadir	you wrote so, right now i don't see the difference
2011-07-27 10:38:42	fsmithred	well, easier to manage
2011-07-27 10:38:51	nadir	ah. ok, now i see :-)
2011-07-27 10:39:00	fsmithred	you can add files without having to make more links
2011-07-27 10:39:39	nadir	ah, yes.
2011-07-27 10:39:56	nadir	so, what you posted: ln -s /home/me/p_h /var/www
2011-07-27 10:40:09	fsmithred	no
2011-07-27 10:40:27	fsmithred	use /var/www/molloy
2011-07-27 10:40:32	nadir	why so?
2011-07-27 10:40:44	fsmithred	in case you want another site
2011-07-27 10:40:51	fsmithred	and also
2011-07-27 10:40:56	nadir	oh.
2011-07-27 10:41:00	fsmithred	I don't know if there would be permission problems
2011-07-27 10:41:18	fsmithred	www is usually owned by root
2011-07-27 10:41:28	nadir	well: there seems to be, else i would have no problems with blosxom, no?
2011-07-27 10:41:36	fsmithred	or maybe www-data
2011-07-27 10:41:41	fsmithred	but mine's owned by root
2011-07-27 10:41:42	nadir	per default by root
2011-07-27 10:41:46	nadir	on all my machines
2011-07-27 10:41:54	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-27 10:42:09	fsmithred	I know some programs that get installed in www have to owned by www-data
2011-07-27 10:42:39	nadir	i fiddled with all that for a few hours, but still no blosxom for me,
2011-07-27 10:42:53	nadir	finally i moved it to /var/www/cgi-bin
2011-07-27 10:43:02	fsmithred	that works?
2011-07-27 10:43:05	nadir	it worked, and now: no theming damn me.
2011-07-27 10:43:06	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 10:43:16	fsmithred	where's your datadir?
2011-07-27 10:43:24	nadir	but that is anything but good: all symlinks, and one not.
2011-07-27 10:43:34	nadir	/home/me/p_h/content/misc.content/blog
2011-07-27 10:43:49	fsmithred	set datadir in /etc/blosxom/blosxom.conf?
2011-07-27 10:44:20	nadir	yup, but, funny enough, i also had to set it in /var/lib/cgi-bin/blosxom (path might be wrong)
2011-07-27 10:45:02	fsmithred	debian is sometimes a pain because they spread out all the parts
2011-07-27 10:45:07	nadir	yes.
2011-07-27 10:45:16	nadir	and in this case without much docu at all.
2011-07-27 10:45:34	fsmithred	yeah, looks like most of the docs on blosxom are for mac
2011-07-27 10:45:45	nadir	if none would have ever started with public_html my life would be a bit easier.
2011-07-27 10:46:22	fsmithred	maybe start over with a fresh install of apache
2011-07-27 10:46:24	nadir	yesterday i said: if i am better with it at the end of the year, apache, all is ok
2011-07-27 10:46:27	fsmithred	virgin config files
2011-07-27 10:46:33	nadir	uhum. idea.
2011-07-27 10:46:47	fsmithred	just save your custom configs, in case you want to go back
2011-07-27 10:47:05	nadir	see:
2011-07-27 10:47:19	nadir	i barely know about apache, i got no clue what is cgi,
2011-07-27 10:47:20	fsmithred	mv /etc/apache2 /etc/apache2.something
2011-07-27 10:47:21	nadir	and so on.
2011-07-27 10:47:37	nadir	cgi? what on earht is that?
2011-07-27 10:47:48	nadir	common gateway interface?
2011-07-27 10:47:48	fsmithred	scripts that run on web pages, I think
2011-07-27 10:47:56	fsmithred	that sounds right
2011-07-27 10:48:03	nadir	its a language? no, i don't think
2011-07-27 10:48:08	fsmithred	no
2011-07-27 10:48:13	nadir	cause there is perl-cgi, python-cgi, etc...
2011-07-27 10:49:32	nadir	i will try it again, early at the evening ( 8:0 - 10:0 am)
2011-07-27 10:49:40	nadir	got your notes, got my notes....
2011-07-27 10:49:54	nadir	but, another thing:
2011-07-27 10:50:07	nadir	for things like making notes bout such things a blog is not bad, is it?
2011-07-27 10:50:24	nadir	not how-tos, just the commands in a row.
2011-07-27 10:50:51	fsmithred	it's ok for howto's, too
2011-07-27 10:51:01	nadir	well: thats true.
2011-07-27 10:51:05	fsmithred	depends on how much html code you want to write
2011-07-27 10:51:27		[dbb0 back: gone 02:04:14]
2011-07-27 10:51:55	fsmithred	I made separate datadirs (actually subdirs) so that stuff would be easier to find
2011-07-27 10:51:58	nadir	i had problems to put a part of your email in html/blosxom-blot
2011-07-27 10:52:09	fsmithred	what part?
2011-07-27 10:52:16	nadir	the line from /etc/apache2/sites-available, it starts with:
2011-07-27 10:52:21	nadir	< <<-----
2011-07-27 10:52:37	nadir	see? it contains symbols of unknown name (unknown for me)
2011-07-27 10:53:02	nadir	ok, got the full line:
2011-07-27 10:53:08	nadir	<Directory /home/*/public_html>
2011-07-27 10:53:19	fsmithred	yeah, that's right, I think
2011-07-27 10:53:38	fsmithred	looks different in email?
2011-07-27 10:53:42	nadir	what do you mean? thats right? i can't put it in html, what is right abuot that?
2011-07-27 10:53:43	nadir	hahaha
2011-07-27 10:54:03	fsmithred	it doesn't go in html file, it goes in a config file
2011-07-27 10:54:06	nadir	put it in a web-site or blog and look, or look at how you did it. wait, i can do that myself
2011-07-27 10:54:24	nadir	i got that, but i wanted to make notes. so i put it in the blog, and that is in html
2011-07-27 10:54:30	fsmithred	use &lt; and &gt; for < and >
2011-07-27 10:54:40	nadir	ah.
2011-07-27 10:54:42	fsmithred	I got that from html code list
2011-07-27 10:54:54	nadir	i ran across it ones, but forgot about it. thanks
2011-07-27 10:54:57	fsmithred	had to fuck around with it for awhile
2011-07-27 10:55:06	fsmithred	damn, that's the only way I can do html
2011-07-27 10:55:09	fsmithred	keep the list open
2011-07-27 10:55:17	nadir	but, the nice thing about it, html, much less brainfuck.
2011-07-27 10:55:21	dbb0	whats the rub
2011-07-27 10:55:28	nadir	yo, dbb0
2011-07-27 10:55:43	fsmithred	trying to put <Directory blah> in an html file
2011-07-27 10:55:48	fsmithred	apache configs
2011-07-27 10:56:17	fsmithred	took me a few tries to figure it out
2011-07-27 10:56:21	fsmithred	now nadir's on it
2011-07-27 10:56:22	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-27 10:56:25	dbb0	if i had my server here i would share my configs, but it's offline
2011-07-27 10:56:47	nadir	you rented a server?
2011-07-27 10:57:13	dbb0	no, i set one up
2011-07-27 10:57:18	dbb0	locally
2011-07-27 10:57:18	nadir	but where is it?
2011-07-27 10:57:26	dbb0	in my room
2011-07-27 10:57:28	nadir	ah, you are  not there?
2011-07-27 10:57:36	nadir	that is the spirit, btw.
2011-07-27 10:57:40	dbb0	hard drive went bad, i think. it won't boot
2011-07-27 10:58:08	dbb0	i think the CD drive is bunk too
2011-07-27 10:58:29	fsmithred	bummer
2011-07-27 10:59:17	nadir	i am pretty sure that in the long run i will go for a sheeva-plug
2011-07-27 11:00:47	nadir	but there is some talk about "atom", not sure if that is a choice too.
2011-07-27 11:01:08	nadir	for us its much more expensive than for you (electricity)
2011-07-27 11:01:18	dbb0	nadir: do you still use compiz?
2011-07-27 11:01:22	nadir	yo
2011-07-27 11:01:40	nadir	they call me mr.wobble
2011-07-27 11:02:22	dbb0	from debian or source?
2011-07-27 11:02:33	nadir	debian, i barely use non-debian
2011-07-27 11:02:43	fsmithred	I'm gonna spam you guys with four lines of code
2011-07-27 11:02:58	fsmithred	nadir, for example, here's the file that goes in cgi-bin to run geneweb
2011-07-27 11:02:59	nadir	perlbrew, flac123, and, as of yesterday, yacy
2011-07-27 11:03:02	fsmithred	#!/bin/sh
2011-07-27 11:03:02	fsmithred	     DIR=/home/smith/geneweb/gw
2011-07-27 11:03:02	fsmithred	     cd $DIR
2011-07-27 11:03:02	fsmithred	     $DIR/gwd -cgi 2>/dev/null
2011-07-27 11:03:44	fsmithred	bb in couple minutes
2011-07-27 11:03:47	dbb0	nadir: 0.8 from testing/sid or 0.9 from experimental?
2011-07-27 11:04:06	nadir	ah, and 0.8.4.4
2011-07-27 11:04:09	nadir	so, sid
2011-07-27 11:04:35	nadir	emerald from bugsbunny or frickeplatz i forgot, but that should be all non-debian for me.
2011-07-27 11:04:40	nadir	why you ask bout compiz?
2011-07-27 11:04:46	dbb0	i haven't tried it in awhile, and kde is broken
2011-07-27 11:04:52	dbb0	so i might install it
2011-07-27 11:05:03	nadir	on xfce it works ok, on both mixed and sid pure.
2011-07-27 11:05:16	nadir	emerald i use, on mixed, from frickelplatz repe
2011-07-27 11:05:18	nadir	repo
2011-07-27 11:05:35	nadir	i think gnome is broken too, but you don't run it anyway (i think)
2011-07-27 11:05:50	dbb0	not in this lifetime
2011-07-27 11:06:00	nadir	i seem to be the only one who likes it.
2011-07-27 11:06:37	nadir	i even wrote a mini how-to bout compiz/xfce, but i don't think you will need it.
2011-07-27 11:06:41	nadir	very easy.
2011-07-27 11:07:36	nadir	the only one i would never ever use is openbox/lxde :-) no kidding, not my thing.
2011-07-27 11:07:54	nadir	well: tiling too. too difficult.
2011-07-27 11:10:04	nadir	in the old days, me a noob, compiz was a few days job. now its a simple apt-get install
2011-07-27 11:10:12	nadir	five minutes, or less
2011-07-27 11:12:42	nadir	dbb0, i got a question.
2011-07-27 11:12:48	nadir	i have never been in servers and such.
2011-07-27 11:12:54	dbb0	i remember spending hours trying to get ati+beryl working
2011-07-27 11:13:01	dbb0	shoot
2011-07-27 11:13:04	nadir	lots of tools use php, mysql and phpmyadmin
2011-07-27 11:13:14	nadir	i am not sure if i really want those.
2011-07-27 11:13:18	nadir	my idea is: kiss.
2011-07-27 11:13:25	fsmithred	back
2011-07-27 11:13:28	nadir	but, as so many tools use it, i might not get around it.
2011-07-27 11:13:30	nadir	wb fsmithred
2011-07-27 11:13:37	fsmithred	tx
2011-07-27 11:13:51	nadir	what you say, get the head around those tools, or better try to avoid them?
2011-07-27 11:13:57	nadir	on the server that is?
2011-07-27 11:14:15	nadir	i will learn them anyway, the question is how and when.
2011-07-27 11:14:38	dbb0	for a personal blog/website php seems like overkill
2011-07-27 11:14:48	dbb0	you don't really have any dynamic content
2011-07-27 11:15:06	nadir	and never will have
2011-07-27 11:15:23	fsmithred	never say never
2011-07-27 11:15:33	dbb0	mysql is a database, so unless you want to have users and passwords for your site there's really no use for it either
2011-07-27 11:15:41	nadir	fsmithred, right you are.
2011-07-27 11:15:59	dbb0	maybe if you put a forum on your domain or something
2011-07-27 11:16:13	nadir	aha.
2011-07-27 11:16:17	dbb0	but phpbb is pretty much plug-n-play i think
2011-07-27 11:16:59	dbb0	you don't need to "know" php to host a message board
2011-07-27 11:17:01	fsmithred	you might get brave and edit some of the php files to customize them
2011-07-27 11:17:13	nadir	i think its rather sweat-n-tears :-) (kidding the admin panel is killing me, that all i said with that)
2011-07-27 11:17:29	dbb0	the phpbb community offers a lot of custom plugins and mods too
2011-07-27 11:17:46	nadir	so my approach, try to avoid php, mysql, and hence phpmyadmin, is ok, so far.
2011-07-27 11:18:04	nadir	like in using blosxom, or llug, or "our" script.
2011-07-27 11:18:15	nadir	instead of gallery or wordpress.
2011-07-27 11:18:36	fsmithred	blosxom seems like a good opportunity to play and learn
2011-07-27 11:18:50	nadir	yup, specially bout the apache/cgi-bin stuff.
2011-07-27 11:18:57	fsmithred	also plugins
2011-07-27 11:19:04	nadir	my blogs name is : wow
2011-07-27 11:19:11	nadir	words of wisdom :-)
2011-07-27 11:19:17	dbb0	why are you using CGI?
2011-07-27 11:19:18	fsmithred	I tried to get a few, but some of the listed plugins no longer exist
2011-07-27 11:19:21	fsmithred	dead links
2011-07-27 11:19:24	nadir	blosxom needs cgi
2011-07-27 11:19:25	fsmithred	for blosxom
2011-07-27 11:19:37	nadir	yup, it seems to be a dinosaur.
2011-07-27 11:20:16	nadir	and that was my main concern/question, like in: does it make any sense to go non mysql/php/etc at all
2011-07-27 11:21:08	dbb0	just search for "static site generator"
2011-07-27 11:22:14	nadir	good hint, and fsmithred beloved webgen pops up too :-)
2011-07-27 11:22:23	fsmithred	what's that?
2011-07-27 11:22:39	nadir	whats what?
2011-07-27 11:22:44	fsmithred	webgen
2011-07-27 11:22:52	fsmithred	I see it
2011-07-27 11:22:59	fsmithred	cli app
2011-07-27 11:23:04	fsmithred	not geneweb
2011-07-27 11:23:11	fsmithred	which is genealogy software
2011-07-27 11:23:14	nadir	ah, got you. my faulty
2011-07-27 11:23:23	fsmithred	I see a lot of python, but no perl
2011-07-27 11:23:33	nadir	genealogy is the big deal of Mr. Nietzsche, so i already love it, without knowing it.
2011-07-27 11:23:39	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-27 11:23:39	nadir	python is hip.
2011-07-27 11:23:52	nadir	the main reason bout 3 years ago i went from perl to python.
2011-07-27 11:23:56	dbb0	http://template-toolkit.org/
2011-07-27 11:24:01	fsmithred	yeah, but I'm not ready to switch to a new language
2011-07-27 11:24:10	nadir	went no-where, we started bash, and then you suckers start with perl again...
2011-07-27 11:24:12	nadir	oh my
2011-07-27 11:24:53	dbb0	i'm actually gravitating back toward python
2011-07-27 11:25:16	nadir	wait, its a Perl_Module?
2011-07-27 11:25:22	nadir	like in CPAN ?
2011-07-27 11:26:01	dbb0	there are a few different ones
2011-07-27 11:26:05	nadir	what i liked immediatly about python is one way, and that one is right (or you must be from the Netherlands)
2011-07-27 11:26:21	nadir	i for one need strict rules, i am not kidding about that.
2011-07-27 11:26:27	fsmithred	v   templatetoolkit-perl
2011-07-27 11:26:35	dbb0	then perl is your worst enemy
2011-07-27 11:26:44	nadir	yup
2011-07-27 11:26:54	fsmithred	it's making me pretty crazy
2011-07-27 11:26:59	nadir	they make me sick.
2011-07-27 11:27:09	dbb0	i'm just using python because it's more appropriate for science/math
2011-07-27 11:27:13	nadir	whatever you do, someone starts "ah, no, there is another way"
2011-07-27 11:27:31	fsmithred	speaking of different ways...
2011-07-27 11:27:36	fsmithred	dbb, did you get my email?
2011-07-27 11:28:17	dbb0	i got a message on gh
2011-07-27 11:28:22	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-27 11:28:38	fsmithred	problem with addpics.pl is that we need to strip off the path from the pic file
2011-07-27 11:28:44	fsmithred	then add the pic to the url
2011-07-27 11:28:56	dbb0	and you used basename
2011-07-27 11:29:02	fsmithred	that was my last attempt
2011-07-27 11:29:08	fsmithred	and that's the one I'm using now
2011-07-27 11:29:26	fsmithred	but that issue was the reason for all the chdirs
2011-07-27 11:29:30	dbb0	that sounds like a better approach
2011-07-27 11:29:53	fsmithred	yeah, I think maybe the code is less confusing
2011-07-27 11:30:06	fsmithred	nadir, did you look at that one?
2011-07-27 11:30:13	nadir	opendir/readdir will also not use full path.
2011-07-27 11:30:30	nadir	nope, was busy with blosxom, and did opendir/readdir training session.
2011-07-27 11:30:30	fsmithred	oh, cool
2011-07-27 11:30:31	nadir	sorry
2011-07-27 11:30:35	fsmithred	did you do it with those?
2011-07-27 11:30:46	nadir	nope, only little training blocks
2011-07-27 11:30:58	fsmithred	I still haven't played with opendir/readdir
2011-07-27 11:31:02	nadir	nadir is lazy at the moment.
2011-07-27 11:31:03	fsmithred	guess I should do that soon
2011-07-27 11:31:06	nadir	its easy.
2011-07-27 11:31:18	nadir	well: as training. real life is never easy.
2011-07-27 11:31:40	nadir	opendir (my $idir, "./pictures")
2011-07-27 11:32:00	nadir	while my $file (readdir ($idir)) { do voodoo }
2011-07-27 11:32:25	nadir	./pictures needs to be something real, i wrote it like that to avoid thinking
2011-07-27 11:33:46	fsmithred	yeah, ok
2011-07-27 11:34:20	nadir	i did an array and pushed all to them. you will want to add "unless" to leave out hidden dirs
2011-07-27 11:34:22	fsmithred	I copied and saved those two lines
2011-07-27 11:34:44	nadir	cause readdir pics them, while globs does not (assuming i am right, which is not for sure)
2011-07-27 11:34:44	fsmithred	oh, I didn't think of that
2011-07-27 11:34:58	nadir	let us ask the master, if i am right, i did:
2011-07-27 11:35:16	nadir	unless ($file =~ m{^\.})
2011-07-27 11:36:45	dbb0	that will certainly match any $file whose name begins with a dot
2011-07-27 11:37:03	nadir	but that is what i want.
2011-07-27 11:37:20	nadir	ah, sorry, confuseled... oh my.
2011-07-27 11:37:33	dbb0	i should say 'value' instead of 'name'
2011-07-27 11:39:04	nadir	i don't get a theme for blosxom, fsmithred, i did your way of linking.
2011-07-27 11:39:17	nadir	there must be a problem with rights or configs, or whatever.
2011-07-27 11:39:30	nadir	(have not been in church for a while...)
2011-07-27 11:40:26	fsmithred	might be conflict between using /var/lib/cgi-bin and datadir in your home
2011-07-27 11:40:39	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-27 11:41:41	nadir	but where is your datadir?
2011-07-27 11:44:03	nadir	and is your head.html with x or w rights? i got rw-r--r--
2011-07-27 11:47:00	fsmithred	glob("*") doesn't appear to get the hidden items
2011-07-27 11:47:08	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 11:47:42	nadir	can i sum up what one needs to do?
2011-07-27 11:47:50	fsmithred	sure
2011-07-27 11:47:52	nadir	a2enmod userdir.
2011-07-27 11:48:10	nadir	edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
2011-07-27 11:48:16	dbb0	glob ".* *" will get everything
2011-07-27 11:48:24	nadir	copy blosxom to ~/public_html/cgi-bin
2011-07-27 11:48:59	nadir	edit /etc/blosxom/blosxom.conf and/or /usr/lib/cgi-bin/blosxom
2011-07-27 11:49:07	nadir	me thinks that is all, right?
2011-07-27 11:49:28	fsmithred	rename cgi-bin/blosxom to blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 11:49:37	nadir	i did both, same problem for both.
2011-07-27 11:49:42	fsmithred	and only edit the config file
2011-07-27 11:49:44	fsmithred	in /etc
2011-07-27 11:49:50	nadir	i chowned bettween molloy, root, www-data, same problem
2011-07-27 11:49:56	fsmithred	only blosxom.cgi worked for me
2011-07-27 11:50:01	nadir	i used public_html and /var/wwww, same problem
2011-07-27 11:50:19	nadir	like said: only on the server
2011-07-27 11:50:47	nadir	for me both worked, blosxom and blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 11:52:18	fsmithred	I think you need to start with virgin apache first
2011-07-27 11:52:23	nadir	both worked in case xyz, not in every case, but if blosxom worked, blsoxom.cgi worked too.
2011-07-27 11:52:26	fsmithred	then my notes should work
2011-07-27 11:55:59	nadir	so: apt-get remove apache*
2011-07-27 11:56:04	nadir	apt-get remove blosxom
2011-07-27 11:56:16	nadir	purge, purge, purge.
2011-07-27 11:56:19	nadir	re-install
2011-07-27 11:56:21	nadir	mhhhh
2011-07-27 11:58:59	dbb0	why are you using bloxsom
2011-07-27 11:59:07	nadir	a) low on resources
2011-07-27 11:59:10	nadir	b) perl
2011-07-27 11:59:20	nadir	c) hard to spell
2011-07-27 11:59:42	dbb0	i mean waht do you hope to gain from it
2011-07-27 12:00:02	nadir	what i said. low on resource.
2011-07-27 12:00:05	nadir	that mainly.
2011-07-27 12:00:21	nadir	in general i try the tools which are there.
2011-07-27 12:00:37	nadir	but, said things: low on resources and perl, is a big +
2011-07-27 12:00:50	nadir	or you mean what i want to do with it?
2011-07-27 12:00:53	dbb0	if you want to go low on resources, then why not use static html
2011-07-27 12:01:13	nadir	for me its a step to start with an html site.
2011-07-27 12:01:24	nadir	with blosxom i simply open the editor and have at it.
2011-07-27 12:01:32	nadir	not that much a difference, but for me it is.
2011-07-27 12:01:44	dbb0	do you actually use any perl syntax when you're editing
2011-07-27 12:01:50	nadir	no.
2011-07-27 12:01:53	fsmithred	html
2011-07-27 12:01:57	nadir	you just open the editor and type
2011-07-27 12:02:00	nadir	one line is heading
2011-07-27 12:02:04	nadir	the rest is body
2011-07-27 12:02:07	fsmithred	but maybe we'll write our own plugin
2011-07-27 12:02:12	nadir	if you want formatting, use html tags
2011-07-27 12:02:21	nadir	fsmithred, good point
2011-07-27 12:02:35	nadir	i hesitate to remove apache...
2011-07-27 12:02:40	dbb0	so right now it doesn't really matter what language it's written in
2011-07-27 12:02:44	nadir	as of now i can't see what i might of changed.
2011-07-27 12:03:01	nadir	in general it does not matter, still i would prefer perl, as i learn it anyway.
2011-07-27 12:03:02	fsmithred	well, save your configs
2011-07-27 12:03:13	fsmithred	cp /etc/apache /etc/apache.backup
2011-07-27 12:03:19	fsmithred	cp -a
2011-07-27 12:05:05	nadir	you did not change any ownerships, right?
2011-07-27 12:05:09	fsmithred	right
2011-07-27 12:05:35	nadir	you got all at ~/public_html ?
2011-07-27 12:05:40	nadir	all and everything?
2011-07-27 12:05:50	nadir	i am removing it right now, i simply ask during doing that....
2011-07-27 12:06:12	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-27 12:06:37	nadir	ok, and to make that work ~/public_html, you did "a2enmod userdir"
2011-07-27 12:06:44	fsmithred	if you go to http://localhost or http://server you get "It works!"
2011-07-27 12:06:44	nadir	or did you need to edit configs for it?
2011-07-27 12:06:57	fsmithred	just a2enmod
2011-07-27 12:07:03	nadir	uhum.
2011-07-27 12:07:10	nadir	ok, so that i will do first of all.
2011-07-27 12:07:15	nadir	and then blosxom
2011-07-27 12:07:15	fsmithred	then touch ~/public_html/testfile
2011-07-27 12:07:31	nadir	wait: so you still got the index file at /var/www ?
2011-07-27 12:07:37	fsmithred	then go to http://localhost/~yourname and you should see testfile
2011-07-27 12:07:48	fsmithred	just the default apache index in /var/www
2011-07-27 12:08:00	fsmithred	got my own index in public_html
2011-07-27 12:08:05	nadir	you left it, and still it does work? strange enough.
2011-07-27 12:08:12	fsmithred	yup, it works
2011-07-27 12:08:15	nadir	ok.
2011-07-27 12:08:30	fsmithred	with that setup, the system will serve from /var/www
2011-07-27 12:08:38	fsmithred	and any user can serve from their own pub
2011-07-27 12:08:38	nadir	let me take the time to really make sure all is purged. No need to hurry now, and oversee the obvious
2011-07-27 12:08:46	fsmithred	yeah, ok
2011-07-27 12:08:49	nadir	ah, and to go to the user i do:
2011-07-27 12:09:01	fsmithred	do that while I go get some onion soup
2011-07-27 12:09:03	nadir	http://foo.sex-for-animals.com/~user_name
2011-07-27 12:09:07	nadir	ok.
2011-07-27 12:09:09	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-27 12:09:17	nadir	you USA seem really to be broken.
2011-07-27 12:09:21	nadir	onion soup?
2011-07-27 12:09:23	nadir	that hard?
2011-07-27 12:09:31	fsmithred	huh?
2011-07-27 12:09:36	fsmithred	it's a French thing
2011-07-27 12:09:44	nadir	well: whenever i eat onion soup i am really broken.
2011-07-27 12:09:47	nadir	but i am loving it.
2011-07-27 12:09:47	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-27 12:09:50	fsmithred	oh, broke
2011-07-27 12:09:54	nadir	it was a joke, yes.
2011-07-27 12:10:02	fsmithred	no, you get that in expensive restaurants
2011-07-27 12:10:02	nadir	we had some news bout trouble in USA
2011-07-27 12:10:17	fsmithred	which trouble? we got lots.
2011-07-27 12:10:19	nadir	soon you will get fresh-rat-meat in the restaurants.
2011-07-27 12:10:37	nadir	I have read and heard that some of the states in the United States are completely broken.
2011-07-27 12:10:44	nadir	Obama is trying to get it sorted.
2011-07-27 12:10:52	nadir	But it does not seem to work well.
2011-07-27 12:10:53	fsmithred	oh, they just can't decide on the budget
2011-07-27 12:10:57	nadir	yup, that.
2011-07-27 12:11:04	nadir	It was a big news over here.
2011-07-27 12:11:12	fsmithred	it's just a matter of making the vote before last year's money runs out
2011-07-27 12:11:18	nadir	Every day you hear about it (and i don't hear much news)
2011-07-27 12:11:23	fsmithred	then they can spend next years money
2011-07-27 12:11:28	nadir	aha.
2011-07-27 12:11:33	fsmithred	which is really our grandchildren's money
2011-07-27 12:11:36	nadir	the news here are opiated
2011-07-27 12:11:45	fsmithred	because we spend money we don't yet have
2011-07-27 12:11:49	nadir	wait. opinionated ?
2011-07-27 12:11:56	fsmithred	no, it's a fact
2011-07-27 12:12:09	fsmithred	we're always running on deficit spending
2011-07-27 12:12:12	nadir	ah, ok. i first ask, before i say: no, no, i read it  in the news
2011-07-27 12:12:16	nadir	same here.
2011-07-27 12:12:22	nadir	deficit spending.
2011-07-27 12:12:32	fsmithred	that's ok to do, up to a point
2011-07-27 12:12:44	fsmithred	but we're counting above a trillion now
2011-07-27 12:13:09	nadir	We got clocks in the cities, which show how much new deficit is there.
2011-07-27 12:13:13	nadir	They raise instantly
2011-07-27 12:13:16	nadir	each second.
2011-07-27 12:13:34	nadir	I don't care, to be honest.
2011-07-27 12:13:40	fsmithred	does it help?
2011-07-27 12:13:52	nadir	Well: everyone is pissing and moaning.
2011-07-27 12:13:59	nadir	though in general we don't live bad
2011-07-27 12:14:00	fsmithred	that is, does it make those who have the decision to spend or not do anything about it?
2011-07-27 12:14:09	nadir	-> a house, a car, holiday, clothes, food
2011-07-27 12:14:15	nadir	all is there. I can't see the problem
2011-07-27 12:14:16	fsmithred	no, I mean the politicians
2011-07-27 12:14:24	fsmithred	the ones who spend our money
2011-07-27 12:14:29	nadir	Like it is for you, from what i hear.
2011-07-27 12:14:34	fsmithred	right
2011-07-27 12:14:36	nadir	Everyone says the other one is wrong
2011-07-27 12:14:44	fsmithred	and they're probably getting paid off by some of the same people
2011-07-27 12:14:48	nadir	Some say: do this, some say: do that.
2011-07-27 12:14:51	fsmithred	ok, onion soup -brb
2011-07-27 12:14:54	nadir	yup
2011-07-27 12:14:56	nadir	have at it.
2011-07-27 12:15:23	nadir	and yes, they are getting paid by the same people...
2011-07-27 12:15:26	nadir	at least the show is good.
2011-07-27 12:17:38	nadir	dbb0,
2011-07-27 12:17:42	nadir	back to your question.
2011-07-27 12:17:55	nadir	I also try tools, to tell the freedombox-devs what is there.
2011-07-27 12:18:04	nadir	what is easy. such things
2011-07-27 12:18:21	nadir	for me myself pure vim would be a solution.
2011-07-27 12:23:18	dbb0	which question was that
2011-07-27 12:23:41	nadir	lol. why i use blosxom at all, instead of pure html
2011-07-27 12:24:31	fsmithred	back
2011-07-27 12:24:40	nadir	oh, that is good.
2011-07-27 12:24:53	nadir	i did purge all, i did deborphan, i did aptitude purge ~c
2011-07-27 12:24:58	fsmithred	she calls it onion soup, but it's made from yesterday's pot roast
2011-07-27 12:25:02	fsmithred	it's half meat
2011-07-27 12:25:02	nadir	now i still got apache in /usr/share
2011-07-27 12:25:05	nadir	do i remove that?
2011-07-27 12:25:12	nadir	sounds good to me
2011-07-27 12:25:14	nadir	the soup
2011-07-27 12:25:14	fsmithred	shouldn't need to
2011-07-27 12:25:20	fsmithred	but I guess it won't matter if you do
2011-07-27 12:25:26	nadir	ok, i already did remove /var/cache/apache
2011-07-27 12:25:28	fsmithred	it'll get copied again when you install
2011-07-27 12:25:53	nadir	the way i "rm -r *" as root its a miracle i never bork my system
2011-07-27 12:26:05	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-27 12:26:07	nadir	must be less confused than it looks to me
2011-07-27 12:26:21	fsmithred	as long as you know where you are
2011-07-27 12:26:24	nadir	sometimes i even don'T know where i am (when ssh-ing)
2011-07-27 12:26:30	nadir	yup, that seems to work.
2011-07-27 12:26:42	nadir	but i got not "stop-button" when doing rm
2011-07-27 12:26:44	nadir	bit strange.
2011-07-27 12:26:49	nadir	should take more care.
2011-07-27 12:27:01	nadir	ok, are we ready to rock?
2011-07-27 12:27:07	nadir	apt-get install apache2 ?
2011-07-27 12:27:14	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-27 12:27:19	nadir	one sec.
2011-07-27 12:27:40	nadir	next will be? a2enmod userdir?
2011-07-27 12:27:52	fsmithred	first go to localhost to make sure it works
2011-07-27 12:27:57	nadir	ah, ok. good point
2011-07-27 12:28:17	nadir	wait, i can't. i need to type: http://192.168.1.22/
2011-07-27 12:28:21	nadir	in that case, right?
2011-07-27 12:28:31	fsmithred	why?
2011-07-27 12:28:40	fsmithred	oh, you're not on that machine?
2011-07-27 12:28:44	nadir	yup
2011-07-27 12:28:50	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-27 12:28:52	nadir	as long i am on the machine all is fine.
2011-07-27 12:29:05	nadir	difficult enough, but as long that,  i get it up (after some hours)
2011-07-27 12:29:21	fsmithred	hours?
2011-07-27 12:29:28	fsmithred	you might be trying too hard
2011-07-27 12:29:35	nadir	yes, hours.
2011-07-27 12:29:43	nadir	ok, can't connect. Now i am confused.
2011-07-27 12:29:54	fsmithred	you got a firewall running on the server?
2011-07-27 12:30:20	nadir	no
2011-07-27 12:30:59	fsmithred	It works!
2011-07-27 12:31:02	fsmithred	that's yours
2011-07-27 12:31:13	nadir	what?
2011-07-27 12:31:17	fsmithred	resident
2011-07-27 12:31:21	fsmithred	I just went there
2011-07-27 12:31:22	nadir	it works for you, but not for me. holy maria
2011-07-27 12:31:27	nadir	i need a six-pack
2011-07-27 12:31:39	nadir	i use the local IP.
2011-07-27 12:31:40	fsmithred	ok, now a2enmod userdir
2011-07-27 12:31:51	nadir	ok, chef
2011-07-27 12:32:12	fsmithred	and restart apache
2011-07-27 12:32:20	nadir	all done
2011-07-27 12:32:47	fsmithred	works
2011-07-27 12:32:55	fsmithred	MT: his stuff
2011-07-27 12:33:08	nadir	wait, yes.
2011-07-27 12:33:14	nadir	And that did not work in the past.
2011-07-27 12:33:18	fsmithred	gallery works
2011-07-27 12:33:25	nadir	So you must have been right (purge,purge, purge)
2011-07-27 12:33:53	fsmithred	oh, the picture of you at the bar(?) is stretched
2011-07-27 12:34:11	fsmithred	you playing darts there?
2011-07-27 12:34:23	nadir	yup, it is, and yup, dart

2011-07-27 12:35:45	nadir	i do:
2011-07-27 12:35:52	nadir	rm ~/public_html/cgi-bin
2011-07-27 12:35:58	fsmithred	well, assuming you don't look stretched like that, you shouldn't scare the babes away
2011-07-27 12:36:06	nadir	rm ~/public_html/content/misc.cont/blog
2011-07-27 12:36:15	nadir	and will re-create them as user, ok?
2011-07-27 12:36:21	nadir	yeah.
2011-07-27 12:36:22	fsmithred	why rm?
2011-07-27 12:36:27	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-27 12:36:34	nadir	not sure how often i did chown and chmod
2011-07-27 12:36:36	fsmithred	they belong to someone else?
2011-07-27 12:36:43	nadir	i changed it all the time.
2011-07-27 12:36:49	fsmithred	hang on
2011-07-27 12:36:50	nadir	to root, to www-data
2011-07-27 12:36:52	nadir	i am hanging
2011-07-27 12:37:22	fsmithred	you could chown -R user:user blah
2011-07-27 12:37:42	fsmithred	I own everything in pub
2011-07-27 12:38:11	nadir	i will rather re-create them
2011-07-27 12:38:19	nadir	too much of borking here.
2011-07-27 12:38:21	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-27 12:39:22	nadir	ok, now i edit /etc/blosxom/blosxom.conf, right
2011-07-27 12:39:38	fsmithred	yeah, for datadir
2011-07-27 12:41:52	fsmithred	then add those lines to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
2011-07-27 12:42:15	nadir	what?
2011-07-27 12:42:18	nadir	are you sure?
2011-07-27 12:42:21	nadir	see here:
2011-07-27 12:42:25	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/cgi-bin/blosxom

2011-07-27 12:42:56	fsmithred	same for blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 12:43:02	nadir	oh, yes, sure.
2011-07-27 12:43:02	fsmithred	you see it?
2011-07-27 12:43:07	nadir	i see it.
2011-07-27 12:43:16	fsmithred	refresh your browser
2011-07-27 12:43:27	nadir	but i did not use ~/public_html, i went through the clicks, from the start page
2011-07-27 12:43:37	fsmithred	wait
2011-07-27 12:43:40	fsmithred	I see it now
2011-07-27 12:43:46	fsmithred	no ~molloy on that
2011-07-27 12:43:53	fsmithred	where's you put it?
2011-07-27 12:44:04	nadir	now that is very strange.
2011-07-27 12:44:19	nadir	I ain't even got no cgi-bin/blosxom at my public_html
2011-07-27 12:44:21	nadir	wtf?
2011-07-27 12:44:33	fsmithred	you put it somewhere else first time
2011-07-27 12:44:38	fsmithred	in /var/lib?
2011-07-27 12:44:47	nadir	i purged all and everything
2011-07-27 12:45:00	nadir	mhhh... strange
2011-07-27 12:45:12	fsmithred	oh, when you install, it goes to /var/lib/cgi-bin/blosxom
2011-07-27 12:45:54	fsmithred	you might want to put it in your pub, in case we ever decide to start hacking the blosxom script
2011-07-27 12:46:07	nadir	so:
2011-07-27 12:46:25	fsmithred	mkdir ~/public_html/cgi-bin
2011-07-27 12:46:28	nadir	cp /var/lib/cgi-bin/blosxom ~/public_html/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 12:46:33	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-27 12:46:47	nadir	uhum. let me first try if i now can do head.html
2011-07-27 12:46:50	fsmithred	then go to molloy/cgi-blah
2011-07-27 12:46:54	nadir	then i willl mkdir and cp
2011-07-27 12:46:57	fsmithred	ok, more soup for me
2011-07-27 12:47:01	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-27 12:47:12	nadir	easy, take the time.
2011-07-27 12:51:45	nadir	nope, no themes
2011-07-27 12:51:54	nadir	no clue.
2011-07-27 13:04:26	nadir	something is wrong.
2011-07-27 13:04:45	nadir	if you go to ~/public_html/content/misc.html  you can see all the paths i use.
2011-07-27 13:05:17	nadir	the only one which works seems to be http://add.more.com/cgi-bin/blosxom
2011-07-27 13:05:22	nadir	without ~name
2011-07-27 13:05:39	nadir	relative paths, full paths, with ~name, without ~name, nada
2011-07-27 13:05:42	nadir	nada.
2011-07-27 13:07:26	fsmithred	weird
2011-07-27 13:07:33	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 13:07:38	nadir	Very weird.
2011-07-27 13:07:48	nadir	I think it is related to the whole html-setup of me
2011-07-27 13:07:55	nadir	I am never sure which paths to use.
2011-07-27 13:08:29	fsmithred	what's in misc.content/blog?
2011-07-27 13:08:32	nadir	can you have a loot at your ~/public_html/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi and check if you did edit the $datadir there.
2011-07-27 13:08:36	fsmithred	is that where your datadir is?
2011-07-27 13:08:56	nadir	USER$ ls -l blog/
2011-07-27 13:08:56	nadir	total 8
2011-07-27 13:08:56	nadir	-rw-r--r-- 1 molloy molloy  64 Jul 27 18:53 fist-test.txt
2011-07-27 13:08:56	nadir	-rw-r--r-- 1 molloy molloy 125 Jul 27 18:59 head.html
2011-07-27 13:08:56	nadir	USER$
2011-07-27 13:09:11	fsmithred	datadir should not be in public_html
2011-07-27 13:09:19	fsmithred	read that somewhere
2011-07-27 13:09:23	fsmithred	just put it in your home
2011-07-27 13:09:31	nadir	USER$ grep datadir /etc/blosxom/blosxom.conf
2011-07-27 13:09:31	nadir	# $datadir = "/Library/WebServer/Documents/blosxom";
2011-07-27 13:09:31	nadir	#$datadir = "/var/lib/blosxom/data";
2011-07-27 13:09:31	nadir	$datadir = "/home/molloy/public_html/content/misc.content/blog";
2011-07-27 13:09:42	fsmithred	yeah, move that
2011-07-27 13:09:50	nadir	well: that makes another step to split the home-page all over the place.
2011-07-27 13:09:54	fsmithred	don't know if that's the problem, but I think it's a security issue
2011-07-27 13:10:17	nadir	Which is not so cool, i think
2011-07-27 13:10:33	nadir	but if they want it that way, so shall it be.
2011-07-27 13:10:44	fsmithred	mine is just in $HOME/blosxom
2011-07-27 13:10:46	nadir	why not start splitting it on several PCs, once one is at it.
2011-07-27 13:11:08	nadir	:-)
2011-07-27 13:11:10	fsmithred	database is separate from the webserver
2011-07-27 13:11:36	 *	nadir makes a note -> database <-> web-server
2011-07-27 13:11:37	fsmithred	I've got ~/public_html/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 13:11:53	nadir	yeah, but inside of that, you got the default $datadir? please look
2011-07-27 13:12:53	fsmithred	my $datadir is set to ~/blosxom in /etc/blosxom/blosxom.conf
2011-07-27 13:13:08	fsmithred	holy shit, I always want to spell that wrong
2011-07-27 13:13:13	fsmithred	bosom.conf
2011-07-27 13:13:16	nadir	same here.
2011-07-27 13:13:38	nadir	in general its ok, but if editing one file after the other it sure is not a good choice for a name
2011-07-27 13:14:10	nadir	blosxom, bloxom, bloxsom? exit editor, check with ls, open editor:damn, forgot it again... and so forth
2011-07-27 13:14:43	fsmithred	got it!
2011-07-27 13:14:46	nadir	and then it comes the files all over problem
2011-07-27 13:14:50	nadir	got what?
2011-07-27 13:15:09	fsmithred	resident.blah/~molloy/cgi-gin/bazoom.cgi
2011-07-27 13:17:32	nadir	without http ?
2011-07-27 13:17:37	fsmithred	with
2011-07-27 13:17:43	nadir	huh?
2011-07-27 13:17:43	fsmithred	but it'll probably work without it, too
2011-07-27 13:17:51	nadir	i still got the same
2011-07-27 13:18:02	fsmithred	you want the whole link?
2011-07-27 13:18:18	nadir	             <li><a href="http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi">nadir's wisdom</a></li>  -->
2011-07-27 13:18:42	fsmithred	yeah, it works
2011-07-27 13:18:49	fsmithred	I just followed the links from your main page
2011-07-27 13:18:57	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-27 13:18:57	nadir	and you got a theme?
2011-07-27 13:19:05	fsmithred	blosxom, not blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 13:19:05	nadir	cause i don't
2011-07-27 13:19:08	fsmithred	no theme
2011-07-27 13:19:18	nadir	well: without theme i had already
2011-07-27 13:19:37	nadir	before i moved it.
2011-07-27 13:20:13	fsmithred	~/blosxom/flavours/foot.html head.html and story.html
2011-07-27 13:20:39	nadir	huh? i was told to put it in $datadir
2011-07-27 13:20:57	fsmithred	yeah, but it needs to be under datadir, in flavours
2011-07-27 13:21:34	fsmithred	OK, head.html and foot.html need to be in $datadir/flavours, and then it works.
2011-07-27 13:21:44	nadir	holy fuck the fucking fuck.
2011-07-27 13:21:46	nadir	You did it.
2011-07-27 13:21:50	nadir	flavours.
2011-07-27 13:22:04	nadir	You are the man of the day, if not the year.
2011-07-27 13:22:11	nadir	Go, someone call Times-magazine
2011-07-27 13:22:21	nadir	thank you so very much.
2011-07-27 13:22:32	fsmithred	cool
2011-07-27 13:23:18	fsmithred	$gt; 10yrs with linux - guess I'm pretty good at figuring out which directions to follow
2011-07-27 13:23:48	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 13:24:04	nadir	i am very happy, though very tired now too.
2011-07-27 13:24:16	nadir	I was at the problem for, say 4 or 5 hours
2011-07-27 13:24:18	fsmithred	cat blosxom/flavours/story.html

2011-07-27 13:25:33	fsmithred	I messed with it for several hours yesterday afternoon and evening
2011-07-27 13:25:37	fsmithred	then more this morning
2011-07-27 13:25:45	nadir	ok. very good.
2011-07-27 13:25:56	nadir	the world shall tremble by my words.
2011-07-27 13:26:00	nadir	from now on
2011-07-27 13:26:02	fsmithred	I just keep trying stuff until something works
2011-07-27 13:26:03	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-27 13:26:19	nadir	yeah, but like you said: you are really good at troubleshooting.
2011-07-27 13:26:31	nadir	i often miss a tiny detail, go nut, shout and scream
2011-07-27 13:26:37	nadir	not exactly patient
2011-07-27 13:27:01	nadir	Shall i remove the fsmithred way ?
2011-07-27 13:27:08	fsmithred	yeah, I don't scream as much as I used to
2011-07-27 13:27:26	fsmithred	now, it's more like I freeze and stare at it, like a predator
2011-07-27 13:27:26	nadir	not that masses would read it, but if you don't care i will leave it, and replace it later with the proper notes
2011-07-27 13:27:33	nadir	ha. lol
2011-07-27 13:27:47	fsmithred	until I see what moved
2011-07-27 13:27:57	fsmithred	doesn't matter either way
2011-07-27 13:28:46	nadir	i tend to talk nonsense,
2011-07-27 13:28:55	fsmithred	should probably write it up as "installing blosxom in a user's web page in debian"
2011-07-27 13:28:58	fsmithred	or something like that
2011-07-27 13:28:59	nadir	i added a bit, so it looks more like i would not ... la-la-la
2011-07-27 13:29:15	nadir	i would not have asked for it, but you really should do it.
2011-07-27 13:29:20	nadir	will help a lot of people
2011-07-27 13:29:25	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-27 13:29:46	fsmithred	maybe post it at fud
2011-07-27 13:29:49	fsmithred	um...
2011-07-27 13:29:49	nadir	its not much, but very complex non the way
2011-07-27 13:29:50	fsmithred	duf
2011-07-27 13:29:56	nadir	complex like in confusing
2011-07-27 13:29:57	nadir	wuff
2011-07-27 13:30:20	fsmithred	yeah, none of the directions were right for debian
2011-07-27 13:30:40	nadir	that way it looks less like i was mocking you:
2011-07-27 13:30:44	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi
2011-07-27 13:31:13	nadir	got to say: i start to like IRC a lot.
2011-07-27 13:31:24	fsmithred	instant gratification
2011-07-27 13:31:28	nadir	same problem in a forum has been much of a mess
2011-07-27 13:31:33	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-27 13:32:26	nadir	if we will keep having at that i see a good road.
2011-07-27 13:32:35	nadir	web-sites, perl, stuff like that.
2011-07-27 13:32:44	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-27 13:33:02	nadir	i gave up on earnig money, but who knows how i think in,say, five years
2011-07-27 13:33:21	nadir	i once knew a guy, he wrote web-sites, private, not pro
2011-07-27 13:33:33	nadir	and he earned about 300-500 per site
2011-07-27 13:33:47	nadir	assuming he did not fool me, but i don't think so.
2011-07-27 13:33:59	nadir	did a lot of javascript, iirc
2011-07-27 13:34:05	fsmithred	I have no idea what people charge to do that
2011-07-27 13:34:08	nadir	video-streaming
2011-07-27 13:34:17	fsmithred	I get offers for it all the time, but I'm never interested
2011-07-27 13:34:23	nadir	uhum.
2011-07-27 13:34:37	nadir	For me its ok, but even if i could do it:
2011-07-27 13:34:46	nadir	some tard hanging in my ears:
2011-07-27 13:35:03	nadir	no, but i want that. thats not what i meant. no, now i want it the other way around.
2011-07-27 13:35:11	nadir	Sir, no Sir. thanks, but no.
2011-07-27 13:35:15	fsmithred	well, get paid by the hour
2011-07-27 13:35:20	nadir	my nerves are not up to that
2011-07-27 13:35:32	nadir	paid or not, i can't deal with it.
2011-07-27 13:35:38	nadir	no kidding here.
2011-07-27 13:35:56	fsmithred	my ex-programmer friend took the attitude that they could change stuff as often as they liked, since they were paying him for the time he spent on it
2011-07-27 13:36:18	fsmithred	unless he thought they wanted to do something impossible or incredibly stupid
2011-07-27 13:36:22	fsmithred	then he'd tell them so
2011-07-27 13:36:28	nadir	i am of the kind who likes to take a sunbath in success.
2011-07-27 13:36:46	nadir	So:if i am happy. and someone tells me: no, now i want it the other way around, i go nut.
2011-07-27 13:36:57	nadir	though in general your friend is right.
2011-07-27 13:37:00	nadir	i guess.
2011-07-27 13:37:54	fsmithred	he was making $70/hr at his peak
2011-07-27 13:38:13	nadir	well, in that case what my "friend" said sounds reasonable.
2011-07-27 13:38:29	nadir	he worked for more than a week at one site, and took 300 or more.
2011-07-27 13:38:48	nadir	keep in mind he was no pro.
2011-07-27 13:39:15	nadir	i see the problem that i disgust many sites which are the way the WWW simply is today.
2011-07-27 13:39:25	nadir	I like sites like the blog looks right now.
2011-07-27 13:39:33	nadir	text, background, only a tiny bit of more.
2011-07-27 13:39:39	fsmithred	yeah, same here
2011-07-27 13:39:40	nadir	<hr/> or such
2011-07-27 13:39:46	fsmithred	we're stuck in the 1990's
2011-07-27 13:39:50	fsmithred	pre-flash
2011-07-27 13:39:53	nadir	yup, we are.
2011-07-27 13:40:27	nadir	but i really hate the flash-bling-poing-popup sites.
2011-07-27 13:40:33	nadir	all they do is confuse me
2011-07-27 13:41:09	nadir	-> i got problems to focus anyway, love things to be strict, static
2011-07-27 13:41:30	nadir	like the way i suddenly change the subject....
2011-07-27 13:41:56	fsmithred	I can handle that ok, just don't flash lights in my eyes to get my attention
2011-07-27 13:42:21	nadir	i guess its like that for most people.
2011-07-27 13:42:37	nadir	that way all they do is waste their time, without getting the info they want.
2011-07-27 13:42:54	nadir	you click and look, something blings, you click there, something blings, you click there....
2011-07-27 13:43:13	nadir	most don't seem to care though,cause for them its more of entertainment anyway
2011-07-27 13:43:26	nadir	(not saying that would be bad, its just not that way for me.)
2011-07-27 13:43:51	nadir	If i want to watch porn i don't want to call someone. So to speak. ha hahha.
2011-07-27 13:43:58	fsmithred	you understand the subdirectories in the datadir?
2011-07-27 13:44:14	nadir	not yet, but i have seen your code and i think i got the general idea.
2011-07-27 13:44:24	nadir	(assuming you will leave it online...)
2011-07-27 13:44:36	fsmithred	just create a subdir for a particular subject, and put the .txt files for that subject in there
2011-07-27 13:44:57	fsmithred	and then append the subdir name to the url to browse to it
2011-07-27 13:45:13	nadir	i think i got the idea.
2011-07-27 13:45:24	nadir	and it sounds very handy.
2011-07-27 13:45:28	fsmithred	and you'll see only what's in that subdir, or in other subdirs below it
2011-07-27 13:45:29	nadir	asssuming it will grow
2011-07-27 13:45:39	fsmithred	yeah, I think you'll like that
2011-07-27 13:45:57	fsmithred	similar to the way you have your directories organized
2011-07-27 13:46:02	nadir	not now, if i do it and run in problems i can look at your site, if its not up i can ask you.
2011-07-27 13:46:18	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-27 13:46:25	nadir	as of now its tiny, so not really what i call urgent.
2011-07-27 13:46:26	fsmithred	I'll try not to put everything in one folder
2011-07-27 13:46:53	nadir	alone subdirecting PC subjects is a good idea.
2011-07-27 13:47:06	nadir	and then, for some, private stuff sure is interesting too.
2011-07-27 13:47:51	fsmithred	I'm gonna try to keep notes on how to do stuff with computer
2011-07-27 13:48:00	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 13:48:09	nadir	if you go to:
2011-07-27 13:48:11	fsmithred	maybe I'll add some old notes
2011-07-27 13:48:39	nadir	- /media/data/molloy/Document/PC/Help_How_Tos
2011-07-27 13:48:52	nadir	there i got notes, but that way i seldom edit them
2011-07-27 13:49:12	nadir	If i can look at them in a web-browser, it might help
2011-07-27 13:49:19	fsmithred	wow
2011-07-27 13:49:43	fsmithred	that's the bitch of it - having to add html code to text files
2011-07-27 13:49:55	nadir	a bit.
2011-07-27 13:50:05	nadir	otoh we will get more used to it. not that bad.
2011-07-27 13:50:09	fsmithred	I tried to get a plugin that helps with that
2011-07-27 13:50:16	fsmithred	but it was gone
2011-07-27 13:50:21	nadir	damn
2011-07-27 13:50:46	fsmithred	and there was another (or maybe a perl module) that looked like almost as much work as adding the actual html code
2011-07-27 13:51:06	nadir	lol.
2011-07-27 13:51:09	nadir	yeah, got you.
2011-07-27 13:51:35	fsmithred	write a perl script to translate \n to <br> and you got a winner
2011-07-27 13:52:19	nadir	ah. yes.
2011-07-27 13:52:38	nadir	empy line -> <p>, next empy line -> </p>
2011-07-27 13:52:40	nadir	or such.
2011-07-27 13:52:59	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-27 13:53:18	fsmithred	just that would make the text files usable
2011-07-27 13:53:34	fsmithred	oh...
2011-07-27 13:54:39	fsmithred	ln -s /media/data/molloy/Documents/PC/Help_How_tos  ~/blosxom/PC/Help_How_tos
2011-07-27 13:54:57	fsmithred	but only if the filenames end in .txt
2011-07-27 13:55:03	nadir	ah.
2011-07-27 13:55:11	nadir	i would first need to sort all that.
2011-07-27 13:55:22	fsmithred	in backup they end in .txt
2011-07-27 13:56:30	fsmithred	looks like they all end in .txt
2011-07-27 13:56:36	nadir	what i like there are notes about git, for example
2011-07-27 13:56:42	nadir	i simply copied a chat from here.
2011-07-27 13:56:51	fsmithred	oh, ok
2011-07-27 13:56:53	nadir	i usually choose .txt as file-ending.
2011-07-27 13:57:17	nadir	like said:its a bit of a mess, but if i ever forgot about a command-row, i got a little helper
2011-07-27 13:57:41	nadir	another example: i always forget how to set a package on hold, and then how to unhold it.
2011-07-27 13:57:54	nadir	echo "la-tra" | whatever with dpkg
2011-07-27 13:58:01	nadir	such things are helpful
2011-07-27 13:58:21	fsmithred	heh
2011-07-27 13:58:26	fsmithred	I'm looking at pinning now
2011-07-27 13:58:33	fsmithred	one more thing to add...
2011-07-27 13:58:42	 *	nadir has no clue bout pinning.
2011-07-27 13:58:48	fsmithred	if a line starts with spaces or tab, add that to the html code
2011-07-27 13:59:02	nadir	ah, yes.
2011-07-27 13:59:11	fsmithred	if a line contains "Report this post"
2011-07-27 13:59:11	nadir	half-yes, half-huh
2011-07-27 13:59:13	fsmithred	ignore it
2011-07-27 13:59:31	fsmithred	same for "Reply with quote"
2011-07-27 14:00:32	fsmithred	could go crazy with this
2011-07-27 14:00:48	fsmithred	I see another 1000-liner
2011-07-27 14:00:52	nadir	yup.
2011-07-27 14:01:04	nadir	telemachus once said <br/> would suck,
2011-07-27 14:01:14	nadir	but he never came up with the proper way to do it.
2011-07-27 14:01:35	nadir	all he said was: "in html it is kind of a problem". lol
2011-07-27 14:01:37	fsmithred	you mean a perl way to add it
2011-07-27 14:01:39	fsmithred	?
2011-07-27 14:01:59	nadir	no, he said that in general the usage of br-tag in html would not be good.
2011-07-27 14:02:24	nadir	as i can't think of any other way, no miracle it is, i am a bit lost at that.
2011-07-27 14:02:36	nadir	I said: how else, if not with br-tag.
2011-07-27 14:02:38	fsmithred	gotta have some way to signal the end of a line
2011-07-27 14:02:42	nadir	He said: it is a problem.
2011-07-27 14:03:04	nadir	ah, and, another thing.
2011-07-27 14:03:12	nadir	dbb0 said a few days ago:
2011-07-27 14:03:22	nadir	br tags should always go inside of other tags.
2011-07-27 14:03:30	nadir	e.g.  in <p> </p>
2011-07-27 14:03:31	fsmithred	huh?
2011-07-27 14:03:37	nadir	which i never heard before.
2011-07-27 14:03:52	nadir	wait, perhaps i misunderstood him
2011-07-27 14:03:58	fsmithred	well, maybe that's good practice for large documents
2011-07-27 14:04:15	nadir	if you ever run across it: re-think, if not: forget it.
2011-07-27 14:04:16	fsmithred	for the little stuff that I've done, it doesn't matter
2011-07-27 14:04:21	nadir	exactly.
2011-07-27 14:05:03	fsmithred	might be more important if your doc is going to be edited by html editor
2011-07-27 14:05:44	fsmithred	I need to go have a smoke and then lie down for awhile
2011-07-27 14:06:21	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-27 14:06:32	nadir	np. we did quite some work the last hours.
2011-07-27 14:06:37	nadir	i should break too.
2011-07-27 14:06:38	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-27 14:06:44	fsmithred	alright
2011-07-27 14:06:48	nadir	was a good idea fo fiddle with it.
2011-07-27 14:07:00	nadir	thanks a lot, like said.
2011-07-27 14:07:10	fsmithred	I think I'll write a script to deal with the \n to <br> later
2011-07-27 14:07:25	nadir	uhum. i will take a sunbath in the success first.
2011-07-27 14:07:42	fsmithred	if nothing else, I'll run it after writing posts and not have to type the breaks manually
2011-07-27 14:07:48	nadir	then i will look at your ideas.
2011-07-27 14:07:58	fsmithred	ok, talk with you later
2011-07-27 14:08:00	nadir	yup. that would help
2011-07-27 14:08:05	nadir	later, have fun.

2011-07-29 13:20:07	dbb0	he hasn't been on in awhile
2011-07-29 13:20:24	nadir	yes, thats why i hunt.
2011-07-29 13:20:32	nadir	and hi, dbb0
2011-07-29 13:22:49	dbb0	whats the word
2011-07-29 13:23:15	nadir	sorry, what does "whats the word" mean?
2011-07-29 13:23:21	dbb0	whats up
2011-07-29 13:23:30	nadir	ah, not much, just awoke.
2011-07-29 13:23:49	nadir	and besides that i am trying to get my head in freedombox-problems, mainly apps,
2011-07-29 13:24:06	nadir	and as most seem to need: mysql, php, phpmyadmin, ftp-server
2011-07-29 13:24:10	nadir	that is what i am at
2011-07-29 13:26:28	nadir	I try to make a list useful for the so called end-users. Then post it at #freedombox
2011-07-29 13:26:36	nadir	a list of apps.
2011-07-29 13:27:17	nadir	Did you ever deal with wordpress, or somelike alike, or a wiki?
2011-07-29 13:28:32	dbb0	you mean creating a wiki or just wiki-style markup
2011-07-29 13:28:57	nadir	Yup, i mean "apt-get install" and then creating one. Using it as a "one-size-fits-all" tool
2011-07-29 13:29:10	dbb0	no
2011-07-29 13:29:17	nadir	damn
2011-07-29 13:29:24	dbb0	and i've never used wordpress beond the web interface
2011-07-29 13:29:38	nadir	yeah, but that is what i mean. end-users.
2011-07-29 13:34:09	nadir	you got any idea how to implement a search-bar to a web-site
2011-07-29 13:34:15	nadir	to search the site itself.
2011-07-29 13:34:40	nadir	I found source code who did it with ikiwiki, but missed to make the bookmark. :-(
2011-07-29 13:38:17	dbb0	google custom search
2011-07-29 13:38:28	dbb0	probably the easiest and most effective solution
2011-07-29 13:38:45	dbb0	example: vim.org
2011-07-29 13:46:46	nadir	a search bar by google, called custom search, implemented in the web-site?
2011-07-29 13:53:05	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-29 13:53:52	nadir	nadir hates google. but thanks. will keep it in mind
2011-07-29 13:57:36	dbb0	it doesn't necessarily have to be google
2011-07-29 13:57:45	nadir	yup, got you.
2011-07-29 13:57:57	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1114351
2011-07-29 13:59:22	dbb0	what engine do you use
2011-07-29 14:00:08	nadir	lxquick or duckduck
2011-07-29 14:00:19	nadir	but i barely use them at all.
2011-07-29 14:01:38	dbb0	i recommend scroogle
2011-07-29 14:02:34	dbb0	action="https://duckduckgo.com/html"
2011-07-29 14:04:05	nadir	but scroogle uses google, no?
2011-07-29 14:04:09	dbb0	http://duckduckgo.com/?q=USER_INPUT
2011-07-29 14:04:20	dbb0	scroogle is like a proxy to google
2011-07-29 14:04:40	dbb0	lets google create a bogus cookie so you aren't tracked
2011-07-29 14:04:57	nadir	i don't want google at all.
2011-07-29 14:05:04	nadir	neither with nor without cookies.
2011-07-29 14:05:09	nadir	:-)
2011-07-29 14:05:27	nadir	I tried yacy the other day, but could not understand it.
2011-07-29 14:06:32	nadir	what exactly my problem with google is i am not sure.
2011-07-29 14:06:57	nadir	it seems to "sell" a lifestyle. something like that.
2011-07-29 14:08:08	dbb0	http://duckduckgo.com/search_box.html

2011-07-30 10:05:03	dbb0	i understand what node.js is, but i can't think of any way that i would be able to use it
2011-07-30 10:05:51	@telemachus	Yeah, I hear you
2011-07-30 10:06:02	@telemachus	I can think of a handful of ways for me.
2011-07-30 10:06:21	@telemachus	One: it can be useful to write small applications that are completely local.
2011-07-30 10:06:47	@telemachus	Like a local todo app, or wiki for notetaking, or an in-browser mpd music player
2011-07-30 10:06:49	dbb0	it seems similar in function to mojolicious
2011-07-30 10:07:51	@telemachus	hmm - in a way I guess
2011-07-30 10:07:55	@telemachus	but node is lower than that
2011-07-30 10:08:11	@telemachus	there's something in node called express which is like sinatra (ruby) or mojolicious maybe
2011-07-30 10:08:19	@telemachus	a mini-framework to build applications in
2011-07-30 10:08:34	@telemachus	To be honest, my *main* interest is to use it for teaching
2011-07-30 10:08:49	@telemachus	I don't like most of the front-end nonsense people do with javascript
2011-07-30 10:08:54	@telemachus	fly-out menus and the like
2011-07-30 10:09:15	@telemachus	but Node would allow me to teach the girls (all girls school) Javascript and then use it to build little apps
2011-07-30 10:09:19	@telemachus	so I'm experimenting
2011-07-30 10:09:54	dbb0	with mojolicious you can write an app and run it in "daemon mode", which assigns a specific port to the app
2011-07-30 10:10:11	dbb0	which looks like the HW example on the node.js site
2011-07-30 10:10:14	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 10:10:21	@telemachus	well, the port thing has to do with ports and privileges
2011-07-30 10:10:31	@telemachus	if you run as a regular user, you can't use 80
2011-07-30 10:10:33	@telemachus	it's reserved
2011-07-30 10:10:49	@telemachus	so normally when you run something local or during development, you use random higher numbers
2011-07-30 10:11:18	@telemachus	so that part is the same, but also true in all sorts of web-development frameworks and kits
2011-07-30 10:11:58	dbb0	actually with mojo i think your app has to be in a port. it can't have a "plain" url
2011-07-30 10:12:08	dbb0	if that makes sense
2011-07-30 10:12:12	@telemachus	not sure it does
2011-07-30 10:12:19	@telemachus	what do you mean by plain url
2011-07-30 10:12:25	@telemachus	www.foobar.com
2011-07-30 10:12:25	@telemachus	?
2011-07-30 10:12:30	@telemachus	without the :8080
2011-07-30 10:12:58	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-30 10:13:25	dbb0	or foo.com/app
2011-07-30 10:13:45	@telemachus	Oh, well, foo.com/app is just a subfolder of foo.com
2011-07-30 10:13:50	@telemachus	that's on a standard port
2011-07-30 10:14:24	@telemachus	but more generally, this - http://mojolicio.us/ - is built with Mojolicious I would guess and has a normal port and a root url
2011-07-30 10:14:37	@telemachus	Though they may use nginx to proxy the port request
2011-07-30 10:14:42	@telemachus	that's what most node people do
2011-07-30 10:14:59	@telemachus	the thing about node (unlike mojo, I think) is that it runs a separate server
2011-07-30 10:15:06	@telemachus	so 80 stays for static webfiles
2011-07-30 10:15:11	@telemachus	node uses say 8080
2011-07-30 10:15:24	@telemachus	and requests are proxied so that visitors don't have to care
2011-07-30 10:15:42	@telemachus	http://dailyjs.com/2010/03/15/hosting-nodejs-apps/
2011-07-30 10:16:06	@telemachus	That's a little walkthrough of some of that
2011-07-30 10:16:27	@telemachus	brb
2011-07-30 10:39:40	@telemachus	back
2011-07-30 10:41:27	dbb0	did you mention showdown at one point
2011-07-30 10:42:31	@telemachus	yes, maybe
2011-07-30 10:42:39	@telemachus	it's a slideshow generator
2011-07-30 10:42:55	dbb0	must be two showdowns
2011-07-30 10:43:21	dbb0	the one i'm talking about is a js implementation of markdown
2011-07-30 10:43:29	@telemachus	oh, right
2011-07-30 10:43:30	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 10:43:34	@telemachus	I did point you at that
2011-07-30 10:43:37	dbb0	https://github.com/coreyti/showdown
2011-07-30 10:44:14	dbb0	i'm trying to figure out how to use it outside the context of a textarea/preview thing
2011-07-30 10:44:33	@telemachus	And I was thinking of showoff, sorry https://github.com/schacon/showoff
2011-07-30 10:51:42	dbb0	the documentation is pretty much nonexistent
2011-07-30 11:07:36	⇨	nadir (~markus@g231053012.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #study-group
2011-07-30 11:16:37	@telemachus	huh - lots of folks here but nobody's talking
2011-07-30 11:16:38	@telemachus	funny

2011-07-30 11:17:18	@telemachus	damn - I still need to work on segregating the memos for different rooms
2011-07-30 11:17:48	nadir	ah, now i see.
2011-07-30 11:17:57	nadir	did you see my answer to your answer?
2011-07-30 11:18:03	nadir	freedombox...
2011-07-30 11:18:54	@telemachus	I think so
2011-07-30 11:19:23	@telemachus	My main reply is this (I've said before): It simply doesn't matter if *everyone else* (not really) uses PHP and MySQL and WordPress and ...
2011-07-30 11:19:29	@telemachus	You should use whatever *you* want to use.
2011-07-30 11:19:49	nadir	well yes, but here i am testing for the freedombox, not for me.
2011-07-30 11:20:06	@telemachus	But aren't you creating your own "freedombox"?
2011-07-30 11:20:15	@telemachus	Maybe I don't know what you want from the fb?
2011-07-30 11:20:19	nadir	one of the main goal is to be dead easy.
2011-07-30 11:20:20	@telemachus	Are you making it for the world?
2011-07-30 11:20:30	@telemachus	Cause if so, and I'm sorry to say it, but "they" don't want it.
2011-07-30 11:20:48	@telemachus	Make your own version - if it's good, geeks will play with it.
2011-07-30 11:20:48	nadir	mhh... not so sure.
2011-07-30 11:21:07	nadir	a server you can set up in the blink of an eye sure ain't bad.
2011-07-30 11:21:12	nadir	one which is cheap too.
2011-07-30 11:21:14	nadir	and so forth.
2011-07-30 11:21:30	nadir	the world, no. some, perphaps
2011-07-30 11:21:43	nadir	and we don'T know how our world looks in ten years.
2011-07-30 11:22:07	nadir	from the view of censorship and such
2011-07-30 11:22:11	@telemachus	True - mostly I don't want to know
2011-07-30 11:22:22	@telemachus	But I still don't get where freedombox fits in
2011-07-30 11:22:33	@telemachus	if it's virtualized, then you're at the mercy of the virtual server providers
2011-07-30 11:22:39	@telemachus	Say Amazon or RackSpace or whatever
2011-07-30 11:22:40	nadir	no,
2011-07-30 11:22:44	nadir	no,no,no.
2011-07-30 11:22:49	@telemachus	if it's physical hardware, how do you sell that?
2011-07-30 11:22:52	@telemachus	I don't get it.
2011-07-30 11:22:59	nadir	the main point is to be _not_ at a provider. peer to peer.
2011-07-30 11:23:05	nadir	the owner of the box is the provider.
2011-07-30 11:23:37	nadir	neither i do get it completletely, nor, as far i see, anyone else. the devs , that is.
2011-07-30 11:23:44	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-30 11:23:55	nadir	hardware + an installer/configurer.
2011-07-30 11:23:57	@telemachus	so, let me ask you this: Why is it such a big deal to you now?
2011-07-30 11:24:10	@telemachus	You want it? Or just something to play with? (That I get too)
2011-07-30 11:24:28	nadir	well: i started with a server (ssh +http), and i try where i can get with it.
2011-07-30 11:24:40	nadir	the other project seems to fit quit well.
2011-07-30 11:24:44	nadir	so why not mix it.
2011-07-30 11:25:24	nadir	you, btw, started with it, before i decided how to do the server physically.
2011-07-30 11:25:29	nadir	you said: sheeva-plug.
2011-07-30 11:25:34	nadir	i read. i read. i read.
2011-07-30 11:25:36	nadir	thats where i am
2011-07-30 11:25:44	nadir	nope: thats how i came there.
2011-07-30 11:25:51	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-30 11:25:52	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-30 11:25:58	@telemachus	I get the sheeva-plug
2011-07-30 11:26:00	@telemachus	freedombox
2011-07-30 11:26:02	@telemachus	still don't get
2011-07-30 11:26:03	@telemachus	lol
2011-07-30 11:26:08	@telemachus	but ok
2011-07-30 11:28:12	@telemachus	You said you were hunting me
2011-07-30 11:28:15	nadir	i am fighting with the app and with the general concepts (content managing + static site compilers)
2011-07-30 11:28:22	@telemachus	Any particular reason or just hadn't seen me
2011-07-30 11:28:28	@telemachus	Which app?
2011-07-30 11:28:42	@telemachus	Btw, I'm out in about five-ten minutes, but should be back later today...
2011-07-30 11:28:44	@telemachus	Just warning...
2011-07-30 11:28:52	nadir	so for me it really doesn't matter, i am at the more basic stuff, which is not strictly important for the fbox, but in general.
2011-07-30 11:29:00	nadir	the apps which the users might need.
2011-07-30 11:29:01	@telemachus	mhmm
2011-07-30 11:29:08	@telemachus	urgh
2011-07-30 11:29:14	@telemachus	what users?
2011-07-30 11:29:18	nadir	you said you where ill, you where not here, thats why i searched for you (quote around search).
2011-07-30 11:29:25	@telemachus	ah, gotcha
2011-07-30 11:29:26	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 11:29:30	@telemachus	had a scare
2011-07-30 11:29:32	@telemachus	biopsy
2011-07-30 11:29:34	@telemachus	good news
2011-07-30 11:29:37	@telemachus	no cancer
2011-07-30 11:29:44	nadir	oh.
2011-07-30 11:29:48	@telemachus	that's the very short version
2011-07-30 11:29:54	@telemachus	there was a bit more drama to it, lol
2011-07-30 11:29:57	@telemachus	but I'm good now
2011-07-30 11:30:00	@telemachus	to be serious
2011-07-30 11:30:03	nadir	yes, thats why i said oh.
2011-07-30 11:30:07	@telemachus	still fixing the problem, but it ain't cancer
2011-07-30 11:30:33	@telemachus	I have an ulcer - you knew that maybe?
2011-07-30 11:30:41	nadir	i think yes.
2011-07-30 11:30:46	@telemachus	Been on a drug for about two years now to fix it. Not fixed.
2011-07-30 11:30:46	nadir	!tr en de ulcer
2011-07-30 11:30:48	@antinoos	Geschwür
2011-07-30 11:30:57	@telemachus	A hole in my upper abdomen
2011-07-30 11:31:02	nadir	ulcers can be fixed?
2011-07-30 11:31:02	@telemachus	painful
2011-07-30 11:31:17	@telemachus	some can be treated to the point that they are pretty much gone
2011-07-30 11:31:20	@telemachus	not mine, apparently
2011-07-30 11:31:38	@telemachus	anyhow, it turned into something else Barret's esophagus - which is a precursor to cancer
2011-07-30 11:31:48	@telemachus	So, from now on, I get biopsies a lot
2011-07-30 11:33:16	nadir	i know the word, biopsie, but i got no clue what it is.
2011-07-30 11:33:22	@telemachus	ah, np
2011-07-30 11:33:39	@telemachus	they take a little bit of you - some cells, very little - and check if you have cancer
2011-07-30 11:33:42	nadir	i hate the doctors in general, so seeing one is always bad.
2011-07-30 11:33:45	@telemachus	yes
2011-07-30 11:33:46	@telemachus	agreed
2011-07-30 11:33:49	@telemachus	detest doctors
2011-07-30 11:34:29	@telemachus	anyhow, I was knocked for a loop
2011-07-30 11:34:37	@telemachus	doctor was not encouraging at first
2011-07-30 11:34:56	@telemachus	when I ask, "So what if it's cancer..." he responds (truly) "Bad"
2011-07-30 11:35:35	@telemachus	Anyhow, that's done for now
2011-07-30 11:35:38	@telemachus	all ok, new drug
2011-07-30 11:35:50	@telemachus	I am actually about to go out for exercise
2011-07-30 11:35:59	@telemachus	should be back in a couple of hours and on tomorrow though
2011-07-30 11:36:09	nadir	yup. np
2011-07-30 11:36:23	@telemachus	what apps are you working on right now?
2011-07-30 11:36:27	@telemachus	So I know to think about...
2011-07-30 11:36:28	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2011/07/30#freedombox-applications
2011-07-30 11:36:34	nadir	and right now: wordress.
2011-07-30 11:36:43	nadir	simply installing it. hard enough
2011-07-30 11:36:50	@telemachus	it shouldn't be
2011-07-30 11:36:53	nadir	it is.
2011-07-30 11:36:58	@telemachus	that must have to do with how debian handles it
2011-07-30 11:37:08	@telemachus	honestly, it's dead easy to install by itself
2011-07-30 11:37:21	@telemachus	unzip, create a mysql db, go to create page, done
2011-07-30 11:37:21	nadir	yes, but you need mysql
2011-07-30 11:37:29	@telemachus	ah, right
2011-07-30 11:37:30	nadir	if you did never do that before...
2011-07-30 11:37:35	@telemachus	you don't know sql, yes?
2011-07-30 11:37:37	nadir	if you have never ever seen phpmysql
2011-07-30 11:37:41	@telemachus	gotcha
2011-07-30 11:37:44	nadir	no, not a single thing.
2011-07-30 11:37:47	nadir	that is the problem.
2011-07-30 11:37:52	nadir	not wordpress itself.
2011-07-30 11:38:04	nadir	I did it three times now, third time was ok.
2011-07-30 11:38:15	nadir	at a certain point i need to switch the how-to...
2011-07-30 11:38:21	nadir	and now i know at which point.
2011-07-30 11:38:46	nadir	and knowing that, phpmyadnin and mysql, at least a bit, is not a bad thing.
2011-07-30 11:39:04	nadir	the other thing i work at is blosxom
2011-07-30 11:39:16	nadir	i am not sure if it ain't too much out of date.
2011-07-30 11:39:26	@telemachus	ok, that I can help with later
2011-07-30 11:39:27	nadir	does not seem to be developed anymore (?)
2011-07-30 11:39:30	@telemachus	the mysql
2011-07-30 11:39:34	nadir	yup.
2011-07-30 11:39:36	@telemachus	yeah, bloxsom is dead I think
2011-07-30 11:39:40	@telemachus	ok, I'm out for now...
2011-07-30 11:39:45	nadir	yup, bye.

2011-07-30 12:03:24	dbb0	they have a lot of good introductory tutorials, but not very detailed documentation

2011-07-30 12:54:36	fsmithred	they're all left-justified
2011-07-30 12:54:39	fsmithred	no indenting
2011-07-30 12:54:42	fsmithred	that's easy
2011-07-30 12:55:54	fsmithred	ok, you want to be really tricky, make the first command in the script be the text editor
2011-07-30 12:56:17	nadir	what?
2011-07-30 12:56:20	fsmithred	then it'll work on the file when you close the editor
2011-07-30 12:56:40	nadir	you lost me
2011-07-30 12:56:52	fsmithred	like refractainstaller...
2011-07-30 12:57:00	nadir	the first command now is "open" right?
2011-07-30 12:57:01	fsmithred	somewhere in there is a command for nano
2011-07-30 12:57:06	fsmithred	no, not true
2011-07-30 12:57:08	fsmithred	visudo
2011-07-30 12:57:12	nadir	huh?
2011-07-30 12:57:30	fsmithred	add vim to the beginninf of tohtml
2011-07-30 12:57:34	nadir	tohtml2.pl
2011-07-30 12:57:38	fsmithred	1
2011-07-30 12:57:40	fsmithred	not 2
2011-07-30 12:57:43	fsmithred	unless you fixed 2
2011-07-30 12:57:45	nadir	ah.
2011-07-30 12:57:55	fsmithred	brb, my coffee is ready
2011-07-30 12:58:23	dbb0	ew, nano
2011-07-30 12:58:49	nadir	lol
2011-07-30 12:59:21	fsmithred	wtf, nano is cool
2011-07-30 12:59:30	nadir	fsmithred, do me a favor and upload tohtml somewhere somehow
2011-07-30 12:59:35	nadir	version 1, that is.
2011-07-30 12:59:39	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-30 12:59:46	fsmithred	gonna change it for you
2011-07-30 12:59:51	fsmithred	vtohtml
2011-07-30 13:00:02	nadir	why we vim!
2011-07-30 13:00:04	nadir	:-)
2011-07-30 13:00:19	fsmithred	soon as I find where I left my geany
2011-07-30 13:00:47	fsmithred	oh fuck
2011-07-30 13:00:50	fsmithred	it's a perl script
2011-07-30 13:01:02	fsmithred	been thinking in bash this morning
2011-07-30 13:01:48	fsmithred	wanted to add  vim $1 to the beginning
2011-07-30 13:02:21	nadir	wait a sec.
2011-07-30 13:02:25	nadir	the main idea is:
2011-07-30 13:02:34	nadir	open in editor, when that closes, convert?
2011-07-30 13:02:59	dbb0	vim $ARGV[0]
2011-07-30 13:03:39	fsmithred	system?
2011-07-30 13:03:50	fsmithred	no
2011-07-30 13:03:55	fsmithred	run script
2011-07-30 13:04:05	fsmithred	with first argument the name of the file you want to create
2011-07-30 13:04:14	fsmithred	script opens text editor
2011-07-30 13:04:37	fsmithred	text editor saves file, and when it closes, script finishes by making the conversions
2011-07-30 13:04:42	fsmithred	adding the html codes
2011-07-30 13:05:05	nadir	ah, yeah, ok. good
2011-07-30 13:05:28	nadir	and if the file is already there, i could open in vim, close, and thats it, i assume.
2011-07-30 13:05:53	nadir	got a bunch of stuff i would like to use, hence my question.
2011-07-30 13:07:06	fsmithred	how bad would it be to not use a temp file on this?
2011-07-30 13:07:21	fsmithred	infile and outfile same
2011-07-30 13:07:44	dbb0	you should probably do something like
2011-07-30 13:08:50	dbb0	my $ed = $ENV{EDITOR} // 'nano';
2011-07-30 13:08:58	dbb0	/ is the defined-or operator
2011-07-30 13:09:11	fsmithred	yeah, good idea
2011-07-30 13:10:40	dbb0	oops, //
2011-07-30 13:11:06	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1110641
2011-07-30 13:13:05	nadir	dbb0, said to use <br /> instead of <br>; if i got that correct. but thanks.
2011-07-30 13:13:09	nadir	got it saved now
2011-07-30 13:13:45	fsmithred	what's <br />?
2011-07-30 13:14:09	nadir	line break.
2011-07-30 13:14:21	fsmithred	how is that different?
2011-07-30 13:14:27	dbb0	if( $ENV{EDITOR} ){ $ed=$ENV{EDITOR}; } elsif( `which vi` ){ $e="vi"; } elsif( `which nano` ){ $e="nano"; } else{ $e="ed"; }
2011-07-30 13:14:43	dbb0	<br> vs. <br /> is purely a style choice in html
2011-07-30 13:14:54	nadir	aha
2011-07-30 13:14:56	dbb0	in xhtml it is a syntax error, unclosed tag
2011-07-30 13:15:09	nadir	you tricked me.
2011-07-30 13:15:37	dbb0	actually you should put nano first in the if chain because most vim users can deal with nano but most nano users probably can't deal with vi
2011-07-30 13:15:44	dbb0	nadir: how:
2011-07-30 13:16:05	nadir	i can't deal with nano.
2011-07-30 13:16:12	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-30 13:16:24	fsmithred	instructions are at the bottom of the screen
2011-07-30 13:16:26	dbb0	you just type
2011-07-30 13:16:44	nadir	what kind of editor would literally print i if you type "i"
2011-07-30 13:16:48	nadir	that is just plain wrong.
2011-07-30 13:17:08	dbb0	vi in insert mode
2011-07-30 13:17:20	dbb0	"dumb mode"
2011-07-30 13:17:50	nadir	yeah, but that is my problem. it open, i type, and what i get is either an i or an a
2011-07-30 13:19:36	nadir	so, anyway, at the beginning needs to be any editor...
2011-07-30 13:19:59	fsmithred	what about $ed = $ARGV[0] and filename = $ARGV[1]?
2011-07-30 13:20:39	fsmithred	well, actually, even if that works, I don't want to do it that way
2011-07-30 13:20:59	fsmithred	would rather just have it as a single variable, and if you don't like my choice, you can change it
2011-07-30 13:23:33	fsmithred	can my $out be ${in}.txt?
2011-07-30 13:23:44	dbb0	no
2011-07-30 13:23:50	fsmithred	why not?
2011-07-30 13:24:06	dbb0	$in is probably a filehandle
2011-07-30 13:24:21	fsmithred	open my $input, "<", shift(@ARGV);
2011-07-30 13:25:03	dbb0	shifting deletes
2011-07-30 13:25:11	dbb0	so
2011-07-30 13:25:25	fsmithred	it would be convenient to name the file I want to edit without the .txt ending and have the script put the .txt ending on the finished product
2011-07-30 13:25:40	dbb0	open( my $input, "<", $ARGV[0]) );
2011-07-30 13:26:03	dbb0	open( my $input, "<", "$ARGV[0].txt" );
2011-07-30 13:26:14	dbb0	ignore the extraneous )
2011-07-30 13:26:18	dbb0	oops
2011-07-30 13:26:26	dbb0	the second one was output
2011-07-30 13:26:49	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-30 13:26:53	fsmithred	thanks
2011-07-30 13:27:25	dbb0	try 'open( my $output, "<", "$input );' on some test files and see what happens
2011-07-30 13:28:09	dbb0	maybe perl automagically converts the fh to a string, but i doubt it
2011-07-30 13:29:03	fsmithred	nadir, if you go back and edit the file a second time, I think you're on your own
2011-07-30 13:29:25	nadir	ah, but no, that i didn'T want.
2011-07-30 13:29:31	fsmithred	I haven't tried running the script on the same file twice, but I think it'll keep adding html code
2011-07-30 13:29:51	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-30 13:29:53	dbb0	it depends on the write mode, > or >>
2011-07-30 13:29:59	nadir	what i meant is: i got a pure txt file, already.
2011-07-30 13:30:06	dbb0	i forgot to change that in my example by the way
2011-07-30 13:30:21	fsmithred	yeah, I reversed it
2011-07-30 13:30:47	dbb0	> is overwrite, >> is append
2011-07-30 13:31:43	nadir	i can't open a file in vim. what is the exact command in the script?
2011-07-30 13:32:06	dbb0	???
2011-07-30 13:32:29	nadir	i get: warning, output is not a terminal || the start page of vim.
2011-07-30 13:32:45	fsmithred	what are you doing?
2011-07-30 13:33:04	nadir	i am trying to add a command which opens a text file in an editor, in my case vim
2011-07-30 13:33:15	nadir	`$ed $blogfile`;
2011-07-30 13:33:29	nadir	and system ($ed $blogfile);
2011-07-30 13:34:39	fsmithred	can I just say print $output in a while loop, and $_ is assumed?
2011-07-30 13:35:33	dbb0	`` is for trapping the output of a command in a string
2011-07-30 13:36:23	dbb0	fsmithred: what is the condition on the while loop
2011-07-30 13:36:50	fsmithred	while <$input>
2011-07-30 13:36:57	fsmithred	then a bunch of substitutions
2011-07-30 13:37:12	dbb0	what exactly are you trying to do
2011-07-30 13:37:22	fsmithred	replace line breaks with <br>
2011-07-30 13:37:29	fsmithred	replace blank line with <p>
2011-07-30 13:37:45	dbb0	how are you going to close the paragraphs
2011-07-30 13:37:48	fsmithred	replace leading spaces or tabs with &nbsp;
2011-07-30 13:37:52	dbb0	<p> needs </p>
2011-07-30 13:38:05	fsmithred	never used </p>
2011-07-30 13:38:14	fsmithred	just doing simple stuff
2011-07-30 13:38:24	fsmithred	I could use <br><br> instead
2011-07-30 13:38:34	dbb0	it might work but it's sloppy practice
2011-07-30 13:38:43	dbb0	but yeah, you could do
2011-07-30 13:39:04	dbb0	while(<$in>){ s/foo/bar; print $out $_; }
2011-07-30 13:41:16	dbb0	it would take a quarter of the time to do it using %s in vim
2011-07-30 13:41:35	dbb0	or even just by hand, unless the file is thousands of lines long
2011-07-30 13:42:08	nadir	i don't think so.
2011-07-30 13:42:12	nadir	you got two commands:
2011-07-30 13:42:21	nadir	a) perl tohtml.pl some.txt
2011-07-30 13:42:32	nadir	and b) vim some.txt
2011-07-30 13:42:34	nadir	same time.
2011-07-30 13:42:41	nadir	but a) is already done now
2011-07-30 13:42:48	dbb0	i'm talking about writing the script
2011-07-30 13:43:10	dbb0	just use markdown in the first place and the whole thing becomes a non-issue
2011-07-30 13:43:19	fsmithred	what's %s do in vim?
2011-07-30 13:43:30	nadir	replace all occurences in the whole file
2011-07-30 13:43:33	dbb0	fsmithred: global substitution
2011-07-30 13:43:35	nadir	not only the actual line
2011-07-30 13:45:07	dbb0	% means the file in the current buffer
2011-07-30 13:47:13	dbb0	if you're typing html by hand (i.e. <p> <br /> <a href=""> stuff) you're wasting time
2011-07-30 13:47:51	dbb0	and if you write a script to fix the mistake you made the first time, that's even more wasted time
2011-07-30 13:48:25	nadir	what about a solution which is not wasting time...
2011-07-30 13:49:42	dbb0	markdown
2011-07-30 13:49:52	nadir	ah, good point.
2011-07-30 13:49:57	dbb0	i'm not saying your way is wrong, it's just inefficient
2011-07-30 13:50:14	nadir	it is clear, more or less, that one can't do all at once, right?
2011-07-30 13:52:09	nadir	because i bet my ass that once i start with markup someone will come along and say that there is a better way.
2011-07-30 13:52:15	nadir	i then start with... and so on.
2011-07-30 13:53:59	dbb0	it doesn't get any simpler than markdown
2011-07-30 13:54:08	dbb0	for the "meat" of your webpage
2011-07-30 13:54:25	dbb0	haml is good for more complicated stuff
2011-07-30 13:54:40	dbb0	not for simple html like we're working with

2011-07-30 14:10:41	fsmithred	whew, thanks

2011-07-30 14:14:36	nadir	vtohtml does not seem to replace anything
2011-07-30 14:14:47	nadir	perl vtohtml1.pl suck.txt
2011-07-30 14:14:48	fsmithred	hm
2011-07-30 14:14:52	nadir	result is suck.txt.txt
2011-07-30 14:14:55	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-30 14:14:56	nadir	and all is like it was
2011-07-30 14:15:02	fsmithred	?
2011-07-30 14:15:07	fsmithred	it worked on my end
2011-07-30 14:15:11	nadir	ah, damn, sorry, no replaced.
2011-07-30 14:15:12	fsmithred	I'll try it again
2011-07-30 14:15:16	nadir	autocompletion fooled me
2011-07-30 14:15:28	fsmithred	huh?
2011-07-30 14:15:46	nadir	i assumed it would have autocompleted to txt.txt, but i was wrong
2011-07-30 14:16:05	fsmithred	oh
2011-07-30 14:16:13	fsmithred	so it worked?
2011-07-30 14:16:17	nadir	yes. sorry.

2011-07-30 14:17:17	nadir	ah, well. too late, i assume.
2011-07-30 14:17:17	fsmithred	but you gotta practice a lot
2011-07-30 14:17:18	@telemachus	this room has changed
2011-07-30 14:17:24	@telemachus	I like practicing
2011-07-30 14:17:28	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-30 14:17:37	nadir	ok, we all together or each on his own?
2011-07-30 14:18:03	fsmithred	so, what I'd like to know is if there's a more efficient way to do the regexes in that script
2011-07-30 14:18:40	nadir	what i like to know is where the difference is between having to type all the markdown or all the html stuff.....
2011-07-30 14:19:11	fsmithred	you can practice on your own or with a partner
2011-07-30 14:19:13	@telemachus	what are we talking about?

2011-07-30 14:20:05	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-30 14:20:18	@telemachus	ok, that script is evil I think
2011-07-30 14:20:24	@telemachus	what the hell is it?
2011-07-30 14:20:25	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-30 14:20:36	fsmithred	converts plain text to html
2011-07-30 14:20:55	fsmithred	all it does is deal with line breaks, leading spaces and blank lines
2011-07-30 14:22:12	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 14:22:12	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-30 14:22:16	fsmithred	what's evil about it?
2011-07-30 14:22:18	 *	telemachus takes slow deep breaths
2011-07-30 14:22:19	@telemachus	don't do that
2011-07-30 14:22:21	@telemachus	ever
2011-07-30 14:22:22	@telemachus	again
2011-07-30 14:22:23	@telemachus	please
2011-07-30 14:22:25	fsmithred	which?
2011-07-30 14:22:37	@telemachus	convert plain text to html
2011-07-30 14:22:41	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-30 14:22:52	@telemachus	there are many, many good simple text to markdown languages and converters
2011-07-30 14:22:54	@telemachus	markdown
2011-07-30 14:22:56	@telemachus	textile
2011-07-30 14:22:59	@telemachus	asciidoc
2011-07-30 14:23:23	@telemachus	restructured text
2011-07-30 14:23:36	@telemachus	I would use one of those rather than try to write your own
2011-07-30 14:24:04	nadir	ok, how.
2011-07-30 14:24:06	fsmithred	that's cheating
2011-07-30 14:24:14	@telemachus	fsmithred: No, it's really not
2011-07-30 14:24:17	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-30 14:24:23	fsmithred	hey, it's an exercise
2011-07-30 14:24:28	@telemachus	oh
2011-07-30 14:24:30	nadir	dbb0 said just the same, but i got no clue how or what or why or anything
2011-07-30 14:24:30	@telemachus	huh?
2011-07-30 14:24:30	fsmithred	I'm not gonna try to sell this thing
2011-07-30 14:24:37	@telemachus	exercise for what?
2011-07-30 14:24:42	@telemachus	now I'm confused
2011-07-30 14:24:43	nadir	wait...
2011-07-30 14:24:44	fsmithred	learning perl
2011-07-30 14:24:48	nadir	perhaps. mmmh.... perl?
2011-07-30 14:25:00	@telemachus	the book?
2011-07-30 14:25:01	fsmithred	also easy way to put line breaks into blosxom posts
2011-07-30 14:25:05	fsmithred	no, not from the book
2011-07-30 14:25:08	@telemachus	ah
2011-07-30 14:25:13	fsmithred	nadir and I were trying blosxom
2011-07-30 14:25:22	fsmithred	and didn't want to type the html code in manually
2011-07-30 14:25:29	@telemachus	ok, trying to manually create HTML from plain text is a fairly famously hard/ugly problem.
2011-07-30 14:25:33	@telemachus	Plain text is too informal
2011-07-30 14:25:36	fsmithred	or mess with an html editor like kompozer
2011-07-30 14:25:46	@telemachus	You need something like Markdown which has a base syntax normally
2011-07-30 14:25:53	fsmithred	yeah, I can appreciate that it's difficult
2011-07-30 14:26:02	@telemachus	my honest advice
2011-07-30 14:26:09	nadir	but then you have to write markdown in the first place, or not?
2011-07-30 14:26:09	@telemachus	1) Learn to write HTML by hand - it's worth it
2011-07-30 14:26:16	@telemachus	2) later learn Markdown
2011-07-30 14:26:27	@telemachus	nadir: yes
2011-07-30 14:26:35	@telemachus	to use Markdown you have to write it
2011-07-30 14:26:41	nadir	what is the advantage to write markdown instead of html?
2011-07-30 14:26:45	@telemachus	the advantage is that it's much less typing than HTML
2011-07-30 14:26:48	@telemachus	no <> tags
2011-07-30 14:26:53	nadir	i type fast.
2011-07-30 14:26:54	@telemachus	here's a quick example
2011-07-30 14:26:56	@telemachus	nah
2011-07-30 14:26:57	@telemachus	wait
2011-07-30 14:27:06	nadir	no kidding, for me its not and never has been an issue
2011-07-30 14:27:27	nadir	you are aware how one posts blosxom posts?
2011-07-30 14:27:47	 *	nadir assumes yes, but thinks asking does not hurt.
2011-07-30 14:28:21	@telemachus	nope, I've never looked at blosxom really
2011-07-30 14:28:29	nadir	ok, one post is:
2011-07-30 14:28:33	nadir	a) one line is title
2011-07-30 14:28:40	nadir	b) empty line, rest is body
2011-07-30 14:28:44	nadir	That is all.
2011-07-30 14:28:51	fsmithred	has to end in .txt
2011-07-30 14:28:57	fsmithred	has to contain html code
2011-07-30 14:28:58	nadir	so, if you want a line break, you have to type it each time.
2011-07-30 14:29:12	nadir	it has no header, hot body (tags), no nothing.
2011-07-30 14:29:20	nadir	all of that is done by blosxom.cgi
2011-07-30 14:29:23	fsmithred	if you use kompozer, you have to rename the file
2011-07-30 14:29:34	fsmithred	if you use txt2html you have to rename the file
2011-07-30 14:29:34	nadir	and thats why we needed an automatic way to add <br />
2011-07-30 14:29:48	@telemachus	why not type the line breaks?
2011-07-30 14:29:55	fsmithred	and the stuff we're posting is just pretty simple text files
2011-07-30 14:30:01	fsmithred	some indentation
2011-07-30 14:30:09	fsmithred	pain in the ass
2011-07-30 14:30:21	@telemachus	to type line breaks?
2011-07-30 14:30:24	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-30 14:30:26	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-30 14:30:32	@telemachus	ok, we will agree to disagree I think
2011-07-30 14:30:56	 *	nadir doesn't get it.
2011-07-30 14:31:08	@telemachus	which part, nadir?
2011-07-30 14:31:26	nadir	a) what is the advantage to type one syntax instead of another one
2011-07-30 14:31:47	nadir	b) what is wrong with adding a br-tag at each line break
2011-07-30 14:32:28	fsmithred	hold down shift key, type <, let go of shift key, type br, hold down shift key, type >
2011-07-30 14:32:30	fsmithred	vs.
2011-07-30 14:32:33	fsmithred	hit the enter key
2011-07-30 14:33:07	nadir	that is how a blosxom blog.txt would look:
2011-07-30 14:33:13	@telemachus	fsmithred: If you hit enter twice, you should get a line break
2011-07-30 14:33:13	nadir	http://pastebin.com/41QhK890
2011-07-30 14:33:16	@telemachus	that's how it usually works
2011-07-30 14:33:25	@telemachus	two spaces for a real line break in HTML
2011-07-30 14:33:31	fsmithred	where does it work like that?
2011-07-30 14:33:49	@telemachus	in most simple text languages (like Markdown)
2011-07-30 14:34:53	@telemachus	a) Markdown has measurably fewer characters to type than HTML. Also, it's much easier to write *about* HTML in Markdown. If you try to type HTML in HTML you have to manually convert all the < to &lt; and > to &gt;
2011-07-30 14:35:16	fsmithred	yeah, I noticed
2011-07-30 14:35:20	@telemachus	b) In well-written HTML, you don't use <br> for that. You should use <p> - separate paragraphs.
2011-07-30 14:35:43	nadir	i was unclear. i should have added: with a little perl tool.
2011-07-30 14:36:02	@telemachus	nadir: Hmm?
2011-07-30 14:36:09	nadir	what is wrong, if oyu got text, to use perl to add <br> or, if that is better <p>
2011-07-30 14:36:17	nadir	you said don't do it.
2011-07-30 14:36:20	@telemachus	right
2011-07-30 14:36:23	nadir	I got around 50 text files.
2011-07-30 14:36:27	@telemachus	because it's very hard to actually get it right
2011-07-30 14:36:30	nadir	all of them need <br>
2011-07-30 14:36:37	@telemachus	no, probably not
2011-07-30 14:36:41	nadir	did you look at the pastebinit?
2011-07-30 14:36:41	@telemachus	they need extra spaces
2011-07-30 14:36:44	@telemachus	do that with sed
2011-07-30 14:36:45	@telemachus	I think
2011-07-30 14:36:52	nadir	huh?
2011-07-30 14:36:52	@telemachus	I'm looking
2011-07-30 14:36:56	@telemachus	what am I looking at?
2011-07-30 14:37:10	nadir	a typical blosxom blog post.
2011-07-30 14:37:14	fsmithred	they need html code, or they'll look like this - http://localhost:7878/~avedis/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2011/07/27#alsaequal_notes1
2011-07-30 14:37:20	nadir	All you got is a headline and a block of text
2011-07-30 14:37:21	@telemachus	That's the HTML?
2011-07-30 14:37:35	nadir	that is why i asked if you would knew it.
2011-07-30 14:37:38	@telemachus	I'm so confused
2011-07-30 14:37:47	nadir	it is in blosxom, not html in general
2011-07-30 14:37:53	nadir	all you got is a headline and a body.
2011-07-30 14:38:00	@telemachus	Why do you have 50 text files? You mean like writings?
2011-07-30 14:38:01	nadir	if you want formatting, you have to use tags.
2011-07-30 14:38:07	nadir	yes, thats what i mean.
2011-07-30 14:38:21	@telemachus	Seriously, blosxom is not looking like a good idea to me
2011-07-30 14:38:27	nadir	holy shit.
2011-07-30 14:39:23	@telemachus	I'm sorry
2011-07-30 14:39:34	@telemachus	but if this is what you have to jump through to use it, I don't like it
2011-07-30 14:39:37	 *	telemachus ducks
2011-07-30 14:39:55	nadir	well: for me it is nice and easy.
2011-07-30 14:40:32	@telemachus	um, this doesn't seem *easy* to me
2011-07-30 14:40:35	@telemachus	but I will shut up
2011-07-30 14:40:46	nadir	it is as easy as a text file is.
2011-07-30 14:40:53	@telemachus	except it's *not*
2011-07-30 14:41:01	nadir	open an editor. type the headline, type your text. done
2011-07-30 14:41:02	@telemachus	because you're sitting here trying to figure out how to convert the text files
2011-07-30 14:41:05	@telemachus	with perl
2011-07-30 14:41:06	@telemachus	and <br>
2011-07-30 14:41:08	@telemachus	no?
2011-07-30 14:41:19	nadir	but that works for a while now.
2011-07-30 14:41:29	@telemachus	I have to run to laundry before that closes, but I'll be back in 10
2011-07-30 14:41:29	nadir	and it assumes that one already has got text files.
2011-07-30 14:42:19	nadir	what we are trying to figure out why markdown should be any better...
2011-07-30 14:42:20	fsmithred	me brb, too
2011-07-30 14:42:22	nadir	:-)
2011-07-30 14:42:27	@telemachus	brb
2011-07-30 14:59:22	@telemachus	ok, back
2011-07-30 14:59:28	@telemachus	nadir: You there?
2011-07-30 14:59:33	nadir	yes
2011-07-30 14:59:49	nadir	http://paste.debian.net/124612/
2011-07-30 15:00:13	 *	telemachus smiles
2011-07-30 15:00:18	@telemachus	If that were it, fine.
2011-07-30 15:00:21	@telemachus	But it's not it, right?
2011-07-30 15:00:28	nadir	no, that is it.
2011-07-30 15:00:29	@telemachus	You have to write some nonsense to add <br>
2011-07-30 15:00:41	nadir	if you want formatting you have to go on. else: thats it.
2011-07-30 15:00:57	@telemachus	what do you mean by formatting?
2011-07-30 15:01:04	@telemachus	how will that look if it's really in blosxom?
2011-07-30 15:01:29	nadir	puh. let me do one, and then link. second.
2011-07-30 15:01:34	@telemachus	k
2011-07-30 15:01:47	fsmithred	back
2011-07-30 15:01:50	@telemachus	wb
2011-07-30 15:02:00	@telemachus	Ok, I think I see. From the docs: "The only rule is that the first line becomes the entry's title, so keep it short and sweet. Format the rest to your heart's content using text and garden-variety HTML."
2011-07-30 15:02:12	fsmithred	if you looked at the one I posted, just scroll up
2011-07-30 15:02:22	@telemachus	so that means you have to add text to your text files now, yeah?
2011-07-30 15:02:32	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi
2011-07-30 15:03:34	@telemachus	ok, I see
2011-07-30 15:07:32	@telemachus	What happens if you don't manually add those <br> tags?
2011-07-30 15:07:52	fsmithred	http://localhost:7878/~avedis/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2011/07/27#alsaequal_notes1
2011-07-30 15:07:52	nadir	you get the result you can see (or rather -> could see)
2011-07-30 15:08:08	@telemachus	fsmithred: I can't open your localhost here :)
2011-07-30 15:08:13	@telemachus	nadir: Huh?
2011-07-30 15:08:15	fsmithred	oops
2011-07-30 15:08:16	fsmithred	sorry
2011-07-30 15:08:18	@telemachus	np
2011-07-30 15:08:22	fsmithred	hang on
2011-07-30 15:08:23	nadir	why huh?
2011-07-30 15:08:29	nadir	if you type:
2011-07-30 15:08:35	@telemachus	I don't know what you mean by "you get the result you can see (or rather -> could see)"
2011-07-30 15:08:47	nadir	i changed it, hence you can'T see it anymore.
2011-07-30 15:08:51	@telemachus	do the paragraphs all become one paragraph?
2011-07-30 15:08:58	fsmithred	http://68.187.226.52:7878/~avedis/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2011/07/27#alsaequal_notes1
2011-07-30 15:09:03	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-30 15:09:04	nadir	it is all once big text.
2011-07-30 15:09:09	nadir	until you add formatting
2011-07-30 15:09:20	@telemachus	ok, fsmithred can you gist the txt file for that, please?
2011-07-30 15:09:23	@telemachus	I have one idea
2011-07-30 15:09:25	nadir	I guess for some things that even ain't bad.
2011-07-30 15:09:32	@telemachus	nadir: Yeah, it's shit
2011-07-30 15:09:33	@telemachus	sorry
2011-07-30 15:09:34	@telemachus	no
2011-07-30 15:09:37	@telemachus	that's silly
2011-07-30 15:09:43	nadir	but i mainly append commands. so i want one line, one command.
2011-07-30 15:09:47	@telemachus	right
2011-07-30 15:10:55	nadir	so: i type my text, i run fsmiths script, i am done.
2011-07-30 15:11:03	fsmithred	https://gist.github.com/1115870
2011-07-30 15:11:16	nadir	i removed everyhing but the br-tag, btw.
2011-07-30 15:11:20	nadir	that is all i need.
2011-07-30 15:11:33	fsmithred	if you scroll up my blog a few posts, you'll see one that looks the same as the original text
2011-07-30 15:11:50	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-30 15:11:50	fsmithred	4c
2011-07-30 15:12:02	fsmithred	or 4d, I think
2011-07-30 15:12:15	fsmithred	yeah, 4d
2011-07-30 15:15:32	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-30 15:16:33	fsmithred	make sense now?
2011-07-30 15:16:52	@telemachus	not really, but if it works for you, then I will shut up
2011-07-30 15:17:06	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-30 15:17:46	fsmithred	well, txt2html did more, like links
2011-07-30 15:18:05	fsmithred	but it also turned my short dashed line into a full line across the page
2011-07-30 15:18:26	fsmithred	and I think it stuck .html on the end of the file
2011-07-30 15:18:30	fsmithred	not sure about that last part
2011-07-30 15:18:35	dbb0	oy vey
2011-07-30 15:20:13	nadir	I for one really can't learn a new language for everything i do.
2011-07-30 15:20:48	dbb0	are you talking about markdown?
2011-07-30 15:20:53	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 15:20:55	nadir	yes.
2011-07-30 15:21:07	dbb0	calling it a "language" is kind of a stretch
2011-07-30 15:21:38	dbb0	its entire eyntax is covered in a single post
2011-07-30 15:21:50	dbb0	syntax
2011-07-30 15:22:31	dbb0	it's just a bunch of shortcuts
2011-07-30 15:23:38	nadir	i for one really can't learn new shortcuts for everything i do.
2011-07-30 15:23:46	nadir	i hope that is better.
2011-07-30 15:24:09	dbb0	sorry to say, there isn
2011-07-30 15:24:33	dbb0	isn't ny one language that will let you completely conquor your computer and the internet
2011-07-30 15:24:38	dbb0	any*
2011-07-30 15:25:04	nadir	yes. still i can't learn a new tool once a week.
2011-07-30 15:25:24	dbb0	who said you had to
2011-07-30 15:26:38	dbb0	i just suggested it as an alternative to trying to write a very complicated program
2011-07-30 15:27:31	nadir	well: as i don't know it i had to learn it, and hence for me it is much more complicated than it might look.
2011-07-30 15:27:43	dbb0	as t said, "plain text" is so irregular that using regular expressions on it is basically an exercise in futility, in the context of using it as markup
2011-07-30 15:28:29	dbb0	i was just trying to save you and f some headaches
2011-07-30 15:28:41	nadir	you gave me some.
2011-07-30 15:28:42	nadir	:-)
2011-07-30 15:28:50	dbb0	do whatever makes the most sense to you
2011-07-30 15:29:03	dbb0	no one's going to give you an F if you don't use markdown
2011-07-30 15:29:12	@telemachus	correction
2011-07-30 15:29:13	@telemachus	I may
2011-07-30 15:29:19	dbb0	well T might since he's the teacher
2011-07-30 15:29:21	dbb0	lol
2011-07-30 15:29:27	dbb0	great timing
2011-07-30 15:29:35	@telemachus	thanks
2011-07-30 15:30:22	dbb0	i think using an unmaintained blog generator is part of the issue
2011-07-30 15:31:39	dbb0	from what you described, it sounds like blossom expects a post to contain nothing but "plain text"
2011-07-30 15:31:59	nadir	yes.
2011-07-30 15:32:10	dbb0	that would really irritate me
2011-07-30 15:32:28	fsmithred	I don't think that's true
2011-07-30 15:32:42	fsmithred	but I haven't tested it with more complicated html pages
2011-07-30 15:32:47	dbb0	you could always hack it
2011-07-30 15:32:52	fsmithred	yes
2011-07-30 15:32:57	fsmithred	there are a lot of plugins
2011-07-30 15:33:02	fsmithred	um...
2011-07-30 15:33:10	fsmithred	here's what markdown does to the same post
2011-07-30 15:33:16	fsmithred	http://68.187.226.52:7878/~avedis/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/
2011-07-30 15:33:18	fsmithred	top post
2011-07-30 15:33:25	dbb0	$formatted_text = markdown( $post_text );
2011-07-30 15:33:50	@telemachus	right, but the text you gave it wasn't yet valid markdown
2011-07-30 15:33:58	@telemachus	I think
2011-07-30 15:34:03	fsmithred	right
2011-07-30 15:34:12	dbb0	holy mother of god
2011-07-30 15:34:14	fsmithred	I just ran it on the original text file
2011-07-30 15:36:18	@telemachus	If you want to play with Markdown, try here: http://jottit.com/wymt2/Test_for_fun?m=edit#
2011-07-30 15:36:19	dbb0	42 errors, 67 warnings per html 4.01 trans
2011-07-30 15:36:35	@telemachus	click on 'Formatting help' in the right hand side
2011-07-30 15:37:05	@telemachus	You can also type in preview mode, where it will show you what it will produce visually
2011-07-30 15:37:35	nadir	so, i write something in markdown. what do i do then?
2011-07-30 15:37:44	dbb0	markdown file.md
2011-07-30 15:37:53	nadir	to convert it?
2011-07-30 15:38:01	dbb0	yep
2011-07-30 15:38:11	dbb0	or $ markdown file.md > file.html
2011-07-30 15:38:19	dbb0	whatever
2011-07-30 15:38:55	nadir	and file.html i can use?
2011-07-30 15:38:58	nadir	just like usual
2011-07-30 15:39:07	dbb0	just try it
2011-07-30 15:39:21	nadir	as i don't know markdown i can't try it.
2011-07-30 15:39:31	dbb0	sure you can
2011-07-30 15:39:40	nadir	what?
2011-07-30 15:40:19	dbb0	markdown treats one or more lines of text as a paragraph
2011-07-30 15:40:29	@telemachus	Try it here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus
2011-07-30 15:40:44	dbb0	as such, it automatically wraps <p> </p> around paragraphs
2011-07-30 15:41:09	dbb0	so a file with a sentence is a valid markdown file
2011-07-30 15:41:40	dbb0	i guess so is an empty file, technically 
2011-07-30 15:41:50	nadir	i see.
2011-07-30 15:41:59	nadir	Well: that is not bad.
2011-07-30 15:42:08	nadir	cause that is pretty much all i nee.
2011-07-30 15:42:12	nadir	one line, one sentence
2011-07-30 15:43:01	dbb0	echo -e 'Line one.\nLine two.\n\n\nLast line.' | markdown
2011-07-30 15:44:19	dbb0	it won't print any <br /> because they're unnecessary 
2011-07-30 15:46:07	dbb0	and about that, i read earlier that W3 recommends <br> in html and <br /> only in xhtml
2011-07-30 15:47:48	dbb0	not just br, but any kind of tag with an empty element
2011-07-30 15:49:30	nadir	i can't see why br is not needed.
2011-07-30 15:49:49	@telemachus	It's considered bad markup
2011-07-30 15:49:51	nadir	If i got two lines, but don't want space between them, how should i reach that?
2011-07-30 15:49:59	nadir	bad or not, i would not know how else to do it.
2011-07-30 15:50:01	dbb0	just start a new paragraph
2011-07-30 15:50:06	@telemachus	<p>First line</p><p>Second line</p>
2011-07-30 15:50:10	nadir	no, than i got space. That is not what i want
2011-07-30 15:50:19	@telemachus	ah
2011-07-30 15:50:25	@telemachus	then <pre>
2011-07-30 15:50:32	@telemachus	or <pre><code>
2011-07-30 15:50:34	@telemachus	most likely
2011-07-30 15:50:34	nadir	pre?
2011-07-30 15:50:37	@telemachus	<pre>
2011-07-30 15:50:45	@telemachus	It formats text exactly as you type it, whitespace and all
2011-07-30 15:50:54	@telemachus	It's often used for codeblocks or poems
2011-07-30 15:50:55	nadir	what, pre or code?
2011-07-30 15:50:57	@telemachus	among other things
2011-07-30 15:50:58	@telemachus	<pre>
2011-07-30 15:51:06	nadir	yes, like poems. that is what i want.
2011-07-30 15:51:08	@telemachus	<code> marks the text as code
2011-07-30 15:51:14	nadir	what does it shortcut to?
2011-07-30 15:51:16	fsmithred	looks like blosxom can handle more complicated html
2011-07-30 15:51:16	@telemachus	they often (not always) go together
2011-07-30 15:51:19	nadir	pre-ejaculatio?
2011-07-30 15:51:19	fsmithred	http://68.187.226.52:7878/~avedis/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/
2011-07-30 15:51:29	dbb0	nadir: why would you need to end a line at a certain place and start a new line right below it?
2011-07-30 15:51:38	dbb0	give me an example
2011-07-30 15:51:40	@telemachus	dbb0: For examples of commands
2011-07-30 15:51:41	nadir	apt-get install foo
2011-07-30 15:51:44	@telemachus	apt-get update
2011-07-30 15:51:46	nadir	vi /etc/apt/foorc
2011-07-30 15:51:47	@telemachus	apt-get install foo
2011-07-30 15:51:48	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 15:51:51	@telemachus	I get that
2011-07-30 15:52:03	@telemachus	you want <pre><code>text...</code></pre>
2011-07-30 15:52:07	nadir	so, for what reason would i want space between the two?
2011-07-30 15:52:14	@telemachus	nadir: You don't
2011-07-30 15:52:15	@telemachus	I agree
2011-07-30 15:52:22	dbb0	what telemachus said.
2011-07-30 15:52:23	@telemachus	but you _still_ don't need <br>
2011-07-30 15:52:34	nadir	no one ever told me about pre
2011-07-30 15:52:42	dbb0	in pre you make a line break with a line break
2011-07-30 15:52:55	nadir	what will it mean?
2011-07-30 15:53:00	@telemachus	huh?
2011-07-30 15:53:01	nadir	pre? pre-what?
2011-07-30 15:53:05	nadir	br is break.
2011-07-30 15:53:07	@telemachus	it just means <pre>
2011-07-30 15:53:07	nadir	b is bold
2011-07-30 15:53:21	nadir	everything means something.
2011-07-30 15:53:41	@telemachus	The <pre> tag defines preformatted text.
2011-07-30 15:53:45	nadir	good.
2011-07-30 15:53:52	nadir	that is more easy to remember.
2011-07-30 15:53:57	@telemachus	k
2011-07-30 15:54:04	@telemachus	http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/f/blfaqpre.htm
2011-07-30 15:54:40	nadir	but couldn't i use blosxom, start with <pre> and with <pre/>, and be done with it?
2011-07-30 15:54:47	nadir	s/and/end
2011-07-30 15:55:50	dbb0	i don't know anything about how blosxom interprets your text
2011-07-30 15:55:50	nadir	ah, now i remember. The text changes.
2011-07-30 15:55:58	nadir	well: any html
2011-07-30 15:56:06	nadir	start with pre, and with pre. done
2011-07-30 15:56:20	nadir	it changes the font.
2011-07-30 15:56:32	@telemachus	yes, you could
2011-07-30 15:56:39	@telemachus	if you don't want to learn Markdown, that's fine
2011-07-30 15:56:42	fsmithred	yeah, that's all we need
2011-07-30 15:56:53	@telemachus	keep learning HTML
2011-07-30 15:56:55	@telemachus	no problem
2011-07-30 15:57:06	@telemachus	but the HTML that blosxom produces is frankly shit
2011-07-30 15:57:07	nadir	foo.
2011-07-30 15:57:09	@telemachus	vile, vile shit
2011-07-30 15:57:10	nadir	foo the foo.
2011-07-30 15:57:12	nadir	pre is it.
2011-07-30 15:57:13	@telemachus	I know
2011-07-30 15:57:17	@telemachus	I'm a pain
2011-07-30 15:57:21	fsmithred	blosxom doesn't produce any html
2011-07-30 15:57:22	@telemachus	I'll shut up again
2011-07-30 15:57:29	fsmithred	it just displays it
2011-07-30 15:57:31	@telemachus	fsmithred: Yeah it does
2011-07-30 15:58:17	dbb0	well, CGI does
2011-07-30 15:58:24	@telemachus	At least, view source on your page has HTML
2011-07-30 15:58:31	@telemachus	no idea _how_ exactly it gets there
2011-07-30 15:58:33	@telemachus	but it's gross
2011-07-30 15:59:07	fsmithred	you talking about the yellow, or the samba article?
2011-07-30 15:59:25	nadir	if you view source in the web-browser what you see is what is added manually.
2011-07-30 15:59:32	nadir	it is not done by blosxom
2011-07-30 16:00:12	@telemachus	The page has HTML
2011-07-30 16:00:18	@telemachus	I don't care how it gets there.
2011-07-30 16:00:32	fsmithred	ok, it makes the first line bold
2011-07-30 16:00:57	fsmithred	and it puts in the permalink

2011-07-30 16:01:31	fsmithred	on whose page, and when?
2011-07-30 16:01:43	fsmithred	on mine right now?

2011-07-30 16:01:55	@telemachus	is that your page?
2011-07-30 16:02:02	fsmithred	well, I stuck a couple of saved html pages in the data directory

2011-07-30 16:02:19	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-30 16:02:21	fsmithred	that's me

2011-07-30 16:04:40	@telemachus	It's not personal
2011-07-30 16:04:50	nadir	that is still much better than most sites out there...
2011-07-30 16:04:52	@telemachus	And maybe it isn't even blosxom
2011-07-30 16:05:01	nadir	no, it isn't, as far i can tell.
2011-07-30 16:05:02	@telemachus	nadir: You're better than that. Be better than that.
2011-07-30 16:05:08	@telemachus	fuck other sites
2011-07-30 16:05:14	@telemachus	Good markup is not that hard
2011-07-30 16:05:23	@telemachus	people just suck
2011-07-30 16:05:24	@telemachus	lol
2011-07-30 16:06:06	nadir	well: sure.
2011-07-30 16:06:17	nadir	thing is that for now i simply try to create somethign like a blog.
2011-07-30 16:06:26	nadir	most come with mysql, which i don't want.

2011-07-30 16:07:04	fsmithred	a lot of those listed errors are bogus
2011-07-30 16:07:11	dbb0	...
2011-07-30 16:07:23	dbb0	no offense, but i'm going to side with the W3
2011-07-30 16:07:30	nadir	http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fresident.dyndns.info%2F
2011-07-30 16:08:36	@telemachus	nadir: I get that
2011-07-30 16:08:44	@telemachus	Which is why I keep recommending static site generators
2011-07-30 16:08:52	@telemachus	No database
2011-07-30 16:08:53	nadir	i found genweb.
2011-07-30 16:09:06	nadir	to me its important to find them in the repos.
2011-07-30 16:09:15	dbb0	telemachus: i think he wasn't interested in nanoc or jekyll because they're ruby
2011-07-30 16:09:33	nadir	i can't find nanoc in the repos
2011-07-30 16:09:46	nadir	but in general, right now, i would prefer perl
2011-07-30 16:10:29	nadir	dbb0 told me bout static site compiler, i searched, and what i found was genweb.
2011-07-30 16:10:55	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-30 16:11:07	dbb0	you can install nanoc with gem
2011-07-30 16:11:14	dbb0	the gem binary is in the repos
2011-07-30 16:11:28	@telemachus	right, debian doesn't provide so many Ruby gems as debs I don't think
2011-07-30 16:11:42	@telemachus	but nanoc does have a steeper learning curve, I get that
2011-07-30 16:12:16	@telemachus	Bottom line is that I agree with dbb0: blosxom is very old and really shouldn't be used for new things. It's outdated in many ways.
2011-07-30 16:12:45	dbb0	i believe jekyll is a gem as well
2011-07-30 16:12:45	nadir	mhhh... so shall it be: pyblosxom
2011-07-30 16:13:26	@telemachus	if you go to CPAN and search for 'static site' there seem to be options
2011-07-30 16:13:50	dbb0	there's hyde, py-jekyll
2011-07-30 16:13:54	fsmithred	I'm confused by this w3 page
2011-07-30 16:13:56	nadir	yeah, i ran into one, but forgot which one it was.
2011-07-30 16:14:01	@telemachus	papery
2011-07-30 16:14:01	fsmithred	every <br> is an error?
2011-07-30 16:14:09	@telemachus	www::staticblog::site
2011-07-30 16:14:12	nadir	no, not there.
2011-07-30 16:14:15	nadir	fsmithred,
2011-07-30 16:14:26	nadir	i got a lot of br, and it don't give me errors. iirc
2011-07-30 16:14:39	@telemachus	wallflower (turns dancer sites into static sites?)
2011-07-30 16:15:25	@telemachus	webscaffold (looks old maybe, but... http://www.bizsystems.net/downloads/webscaffold/)
2011-07-30 16:15:56	dbb0	cat sp_guide.head > sp_guide.xml; markdown sp_guide.md >> sp_guide.xml; cat sp_guide.foot >> sp_guide.xml && rsync foo
2011-07-30 16:16:02	dbb0	^^ my static site generator
2011-07-30 16:16:35	nadir	rsync foo?
2011-07-30 16:16:45	nadir	now what is that supposed to do?
2011-07-30 16:17:14	dbb0	do you really want to see my host and username?
2011-07-30 16:17:32	nadir	ah
2011-07-30 16:17:40	dbb0	 rsync -e ssh -av --exclude=".*" ~/web/dbbo.us dbbolton@graffias.dreamhost.com:~/
2011-07-30 16:19:16	dbb0	without my pass or ssh key it's prett useless
2011-07-30 16:21:48	fsmithred	I got two errors. How do I fix them? http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F68.187.226.52%3A7878%2F~avedis%2Fcgi-bin%2Fblosxom.cgi%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.2
2011-07-30 16:22:02	nadir	but, to sum it up, something around the lines of all that above was my question in the thread, telemachus
2011-07-30 16:22:21	@telemachus	nadir: Sorry?
2011-07-30 16:22:37	nadir	nothing of it is done in a day, hence i wanted to know what others use, what they recommend, etc.
2011-07-30 16:22:49	nadir	the thread about apps for the freedombox.
2011-07-30 16:22:50	dbb0	fsmithred: read the bold text
2011-07-30 16:22:58	dbb0	follow the link
2011-07-30 16:23:06	dbb0	s/&/$amp;/g
2011-07-30 16:23:07	@telemachus	fsmithred: You can't have a raw & in html
2011-07-30 16:23:10	nadir	i am happy with blosxom, but could have avoided it...
2011-07-30 16:23:23	@telemachus	s/&/&amp;/g
2011-07-30 16:23:31	dbb0	oops
2011-07-30 16:23:34	@telemachus	np
2011-07-30 16:23:39	dbb0	i cannot fucking type today
2011-07-30 16:24:15	dbb0	btw, telemachus why the fuck can't twitter handle < >
2011-07-30 16:24:19	fsmithred	so any ampersand in the text has to be handled in a special way?
2011-07-30 16:24:25	@telemachus	fsmithred: yes
2011-07-30 16:24:30	fsmithred	ok., thanks
2011-07-30 16:24:36	@telemachus	it's one of a large group of characters that HTML doesn't want raw
2011-07-30 16:24:40	@telemachus	also < and >
2011-07-30 16:24:51	@telemachus	dbb0: probably some simple-minded xss protection
2011-07-30 16:24:58	@telemachus	they get stripped, I would guess
2011-07-30 16:26:05	fsmithred	the & is showing up, but I know that < and > got stripped
2011-07-30 16:26:35	dbb0	telemachus: i suspected it was something like s/</&lt;/g then AFTERWARD s/&/&amp;/g; because if you look at the source you end up with &amp;lt;
2011-07-30 16:27:35	@telemachus	yeah, that looks like a mistake on their part then, dbb0
2011-07-30 16:28:07	@telemachus	fsmithred: Sorry I was answering dbb0's question about Twitter
2011-07-30 16:28:23	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-30 16:31:37	nadir	time for beans.
2011-07-30 16:31:56	nadir	see us.
2011-07-30 16:31:57	fsmithred	and I need to go pick some blueberries, before the birds get them all
2011-07-30 16:32:02	nadir	lol.
2011-07-30 16:32:03	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-30 16:32:11	@telemachus	enjoy beans and bluberries
2011-07-30 16:32:16	fsmithred	yuk
2011-07-30 16:32:21	fsmithred	thanks for help, guys
2011-07-30 16:32:21	nadir	thanks, bye all
2011-07-30 16:32:22	@telemachus	well, not together
2011-07-30 16:32:26	fsmithred	bye
2011-07-30 16:32:29	@telemachus	bye
2011-07-30 16:32:33	⇦	nadir (~markus@g231053012.adsl.alicedsl.de) has quit (Quit: life sucks:-))
2011-07-30 16:32:35	⇦	fsmithred (~fsmithred@68-187-226-52.dhcp.oxfr.ma.charter.com) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2011-07-30 16:32:49	@telemachus	I think we mostly pissed nadir off, frankly
2011-07-30 16:32:52	@telemachus	Not so much help really
2011-07-30 16:34:42	dbb0	why
2011-07-30 16:35:33	@telemachus	Hmm - I think he was just annoyed at us being (1) fussy about markup and (2) telling him blosxom sucked
2011-07-30 16:35:44	@telemachus	That was my sense anyhow. Could be wrong.
2011-07-30 16:35:57	@telemachus	Also, I have no idea how long they were on it before I showed up.
2011-07-30 16:36:09	@telemachus	But right away, my reaction was "yuk, use markdown"
2011-07-30 16:36:18	@telemachus	and they said, yeah dbb0 said so too, but why...
2011-07-30 16:36:20	@telemachus	etc.
2011-07-30 16:37:58	dbb0	i thought maybe they were irritated that i shot down the idea to write a program to inject <p> and <br> into the text
2011-07-30 16:38:15	@telemachus	well, right, I immediately shot it down too - not knowing you had
2011-07-30 16:38:34	@telemachus	Hence, I think we ended up (Inadvertently) ganging up on them, so to speak
2011-07-30 16:39:32	dbb0	just imagined what would have happened in #perl
2011-07-30 16:40:56	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 16:40:58	@telemachus	ugly
2011-07-30 16:43:29	dbb0	sometimes knowing a bit of programming will cause more problems than it solves
2011-07-30 16:43:39	@telemachus	How do you mean?
2011-07-30 16:44:10	dbb0	have you ever heard the expression "i know just enough to be dangerous"
2011-07-30 16:45:11	@telemachus	yes
2011-07-30 16:46:08	dbb0	like the idea for that program
2011-07-30 16:46:19	@telemachus	the insert <br> program
2011-07-30 16:46:22	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 16:47:13	dbb0	they knew the basic structure of how to write it, but didn't forsee how many screwups could arise from that
2011-07-30 16:47:29	@telemachus	mhmm
2011-07-30 16:47:40	dbb0	i struggled with the "there's a mod for that
2011-07-30 16:47:43	dbb0	"
2011-07-30 16:47:52	@telemachus	What I can never decide is if I'm being unhelpfully fussy when I immediately think "don't do that!"
2011-07-30 16:48:02	dbb0	mentality of the perl community for some time
2011-07-30 16:48:22	@telemachus	which one?
2011-07-30 16:49:05	dbb0	when i would be working on some program and come across a problem and someone in perl says "just use Foo::Bar"
2011-07-30 16:49:20	@telemachus	ah, right
2011-07-30 16:49:21	dbb0	it's disheartening until you realize that cpan is your friend
2011-07-30 16:49:59	dbb0	but they're adults and they respect your opinion even if they don't follow your advice
2011-07-30 16:50:19	dbb0	i think they realize that neither one of us is telling them what to do
2011-07-30 16:50:21	@telemachus	Have you ever read this? http://perl.plover.com/yak/12views/samples/notes.html#sl-3
2011-07-30 16:50:45	dbb0	no
2011-07-30 16:50:50	@telemachus	I sometimes feel like I *am* telling them what to do because I *want* to so very much push them away from manually inserting <br> into HTML
2011-07-30 16:50:53	@telemachus	lol
2011-07-30 16:51:05	@telemachus	It's by Mark Jason Dominus (Higher Order Perl)
2011-07-30 16:51:14	@telemachus	It's worth reading - really made me rethink some things.
2011-07-30 16:51:42	dbb0	yeah, i know what you mean. it's like "but you could save yourself so much trouble if you just did it this other way"
2011-07-30 16:51:50	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 16:52:03	dbb0	"but i like my way better"
2011-07-30 16:52:07	@telemachus	But his point about learning other languages isn't crazy.
2011-07-30 16:52:20	@telemachus	I sometimes think "Fuck, do I have to learn *another* markup today?"
2011-07-30 16:52:32	@telemachus	Or yet another nosql variant or whatever
2011-07-30 16:52:56	dbb0	i feel like at this point in the game, knowing markdown is part of being a well-rounded html-er
2011-07-30 16:53:14	@telemachus	Oh, I agree
2011-07-30 16:53:24	dbb0	well, not necessarily markdown. but it's the simplest one i've seen
2011-07-30 16:53:25	@telemachus	But I sympathize with his larger feeling of "Fuck, more stuff to learn."
2011-07-30 16:53:33	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-30 16:53:39	@telemachus	I think Markdown is the best one, and I've tried a bunch, but yeah
2011-07-30 16:53:52	dbb0	but my understanding is that this is a hobby/pasttime
2011-07-30 16:53:56	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 16:54:12	dbb0	so it's just going to pass more time
2011-07-30 16:54:19	dbb0	to learn md
2011-07-30 16:54:20	@telemachus	but for nadir certainly a very consuming one
2011-07-30 16:54:40	@telemachus	he puts a lot of pressure on himself I think - gets annoyed if it doesn't quickly click/make sense
2011-07-30 16:54:48	@telemachus	anyhow, i should stop over-analyzing
2011-07-30 16:54:53	@telemachus	a downfall of mine
2011-07-30 16:54:57	@telemachus	I read too much into everything
2011-07-30 16:55:56	dbb0	i'm sure if he felt like he was being bitched at he would have said something or left
2011-07-30 16:56:02	@telemachus	anyhow, that slide is interesting
2011-07-30 16:56:10	@telemachus	if not now, bookmark it
2011-07-30 16:56:19	@telemachus	It's a good one for an intermediate Perler to think on, I think
2011-07-30 16:58:09	dbb0	i added it on delicious
2011-07-30 17:00:07	@telemachus	cool
2011-07-30 17:00:15	dbb0	pinboard looks so much better, but i'm too cheap to cough up the ten bucks
2011-07-30 17:00:42	@telemachus	yeah, I guess - that said, ten bucks now is better than 12 in December
2011-07-30 17:00:49	@telemachus	and it is a one-time fee
2011-07-30 17:00:51	@telemachus	ever
2011-07-30 17:01:02	@telemachus	I'll say this, I love it. Glad I switched
2011-07-30 17:01:14	@telemachus	but if Delicious is working, it looks like they won't be closing, so...
2011-07-30 17:03:33	dbb0	i have to wait until my fall student loans show up
2011-07-30 17:03:41	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 17:03:50	@telemachus	are you starting grad school or senior year or what?
2011-07-30 17:07:42	dbb0	well i was accepted as a grad student in ling and they offered me a teaching position, but it turns out that you can only take 1 undergrad course per semester as a grad student
2011-07-30 17:08:06	dbb0	and that interfered with my pre-med schedule
2011-07-30 17:08:30	dbb0	so i'm staying as an undergrad for an extra year to finish that up
2011-07-30 17:08:55	@telemachus	ah, cool - I didn't realize you were pre-med
2011-07-30 17:10:25	dbb0	i wanted to start day trading full time but my parents want me to go to professional school first
2011-07-30 17:14:46	dbb0	actually my dad wanted me to stick with comp sci because he thinks that it would have led to a career that i would enjoy more
2011-07-30 17:16:29	@telemachus	but you weren't into it?
2011-07-30 17:22:23	dbb0	the first CS course was java and i fucking hated programming for 3 years after that
2011-07-30 17:23:02	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-30 17:23:03	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-30 17:23:05	@telemachus	ok
2011-07-30 17:23:09	@telemachus	I can see that I think
2011-07-30 17:23:29	dbb0	it wasn't just the fact that it was java
2011-07-30 17:23:44	dbb0	bad teacher, inane programming assignments, etc.
2011-07-30 17:23:46	@telemachus	teacher?
2011-07-30 17:23:47	@telemachus	ah, yeah
2011-07-30 17:24:25	@telemachus	cs 101 is probably not so much fun almost no matter what/who - or at least, it has huge potential to suck
2011-07-30 17:24:40	dbb0	i think it's sadistic, making kids who have mostly never written a program start out in java
2011-07-30 17:25:05	dbb0	if it had been python, i think i would have kept with it
2011-07-30 17:25:08	dbb0	or even C
2011-07-30 17:26:36	@telemachus	C can be brutal on people - the amount of math and manual memory management
2011-07-30 17:26:54	@telemachus	But it's far cleaner to write/read than java I think - in my experience of both
2011-07-30 17:26:57	dbb0	well i became a math major
2011-07-30 17:27:07	@telemachus	ah, right, so maybe that's just me
2011-07-30 17:27:14	@telemachus	<- very weak in math
2011-07-30 17:27:27	@telemachus	Did you see the new Justin Timberlake movie?
2011-07-30 17:27:37	dbb0	you're more in the humanities realm i take it
2011-07-30 17:27:41	dbb0	is that a joke?
2011-07-30 17:27:49	@telemachus	actually, no
2011-07-30 17:27:54	@telemachus	I'm a married guy
2011-07-30 17:27:55	@telemachus	I saw it
2011-07-30 17:27:57	 *	telemachus sighs
2011-07-30 17:27:58	@telemachus	anyhow
2011-07-30 17:28:16	@telemachus	in the movie, the Timberlake character is fantastically bad at math
2011-07-30 17:28:32	@telemachus	so bad that at one point, someone asks "How tall is that fence?" and he says
2011-07-30 17:29:01	@telemachus	Well, I'm 6ft and that's about three times as tall as me, so...93ft? Wow, that's really tall. But I guess they want to keep people out..."
2011-07-30 17:29:07	@telemachus	Running gag
2011-07-30 17:29:12	@telemachus	that he can't do basic arithmetic
2011-07-30 17:29:15	@telemachus	I'm like that
2011-07-30 17:29:28	@telemachus	still can't really do times tables for 6 and above
2011-07-30 17:29:33	@telemachus	unless I go very slow
2011-07-30 17:29:46	@telemachus	the funny thing is htat I'm a whiz at the abstract part
2011-07-30 17:29:55	dbb0	i factor things mentally to make it easier
2011-07-30 17:30:01	@telemachus	logic, sets, algebra
2011-07-30 17:30:15	@telemachus	but anything with real numbers, I'm just sad
2011-07-30 17:30:22	dbb0	have you ever had to write mathematical proofs
2011-07-30 17:31:06	dbb0	for like a class or anything
2011-07-30 17:31:06	@telemachus	I remember doing some geometric proofs
2011-07-30 17:31:15	@telemachus	and many, many proofs in logic
2011-07-30 17:31:23	@telemachus	symbolic logic
2011-07-30 17:31:30	@telemachus	no other math proofs though
2011-07-30 17:32:06	dbb0	our curriculum is so disorganized that i've had basic logic and set theory in 3 separate classes
2011-07-30 17:32:20	dbb0	and basic phonology in 3
2011-07-30 17:32:50	dbb0	they can't just have a set theory class and let you get on with your life
2011-07-30 17:33:02	dbb0	they have to assume that you've never seen it before
2011-07-30 17:33:17	@telemachus	many departments are like that, sometimes because the profs can't be bothered to compare notes
2011-07-30 17:34:16	dbb0	ugh
2011-07-30 17:35:47	@telemachus	It's sad but true. Also they may all prefer to teach the basics of something (easier work for them, less difficult for students -> happier classes, etc.)
2011-07-30 17:38:28	dbb0	i actually wanted to be a teacher for a long time
2011-07-30 17:38:43	 *	telemachus too - at the college level that is
2011-07-30 17:39:16	dbb0	what changed
2011-07-30 17:40:10	@telemachus	Not so much, really. Jobs were scarce, I didn't publish much, and my wife was going to be starting grad school in NYC.
2011-07-30 17:40:30	@telemachus	So at that point, I'd had two short-term jobs (two years, then one year)
2011-07-30 17:40:55	@telemachus	and when I applied for stuff in NYC, I got many callbacks from high schools, but none for colleges
2011-07-30 17:40:58	@telemachus	So I switched
2011-07-30 17:41:08	@telemachus	at the time, it was just pragmatic
2011-07-30 17:42:56	@telemachus	There are things about high school I hate but I don't have to worry about publishing. And I was able to switch to programming, even though I'm self taught. I couldn't do that in a college.
2011-07-30 17:43:00	 *	telemachus shrugs
2011-07-30 17:43:07	@telemachus	Not perfect, but I'm happy overall
2011-07-30 17:43:19	@telemachus	I love teaching - that was always my favorite part of it all
2011-07-30 17:43:25	@telemachus	(more than research)
2011-07-30 17:44:04	dbb0	yeah, that's why i decided i didn't really want to be a prof
2011-07-30 17:45:36	@telemachus	teaching can be amazing
2011-07-30 17:45:46	@telemachus	though students can also drive you to drink at times
2011-07-30 17:46:30	@telemachus	btw, the Timberlake thing - my wife could not stop laughing every time they did that joke. Kind of depressing for me, but funny too.
2011-07-30 17:47:18	dbb0	is she a math whiz
2011-07-30 17:47:22	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 17:47:50	@telemachus	started as an engineering student (though she switched to Classics later)
2011-07-30 17:48:28	@telemachus	But yeah, she's outstanding at math - watches me figure out tips on my fingers...
2011-07-30 17:49:33	dbb0	i was just learning about multiplication/division on the soroban abacus today
2011-07-30 17:50:19	@telemachus	I'm looking at wikipedia - interesting
2011-07-30 17:50:24	dbb0	counting on fingers reminded me of it
2011-07-30 17:50:50	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 17:50:52	dbb0	have you ever seen this method
2011-07-30 17:50:54	dbb0	www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd_Bub5jEJY
2011-07-30 17:51:26	@telemachus	no - I'll have to check that out
2011-07-30 17:51:43	@telemachus	I was blown away by the trick for multiples of 9 and your two hands
2011-07-30 17:51:49	@telemachus	do you know that one?
2011-07-30 17:52:18	dbb0	i don't think so
2011-07-30 17:52:56	@telemachus	http://multiplication.com/lesson10_nines_fingers.htm
2011-07-30 17:53:01	@telemachus	Silly, but it works well
2011-07-30 17:55:41	dbb0	because 9x = 10x - x
2011-07-30 17:56:16	 *	telemachus nods
2011-07-30 17:56:55	dbb0	did you know that any integer whose digits sum is divisible by nine is itself divisible by nine
2011-07-30 17:57:32	@telemachus	Nope
2011-07-30 17:57:39	dbb0	we had to prove that in one class
2011-07-30 17:58:24	dbb0	i thought modular arithmetic was a real drag
2011-07-30 17:59:11	@telemachus	What does modular arithmetic cover?
2011-07-30 17:59:25	dbb0	you know the modulus operator in perl
2011-07-30 17:59:59	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-30 18:00:11	dbb0	that
2011-07-30 18:00:23	dbb0	the number on the right is the modulus
2011-07-30 18:00:24	@telemachus	a whole semester of remainder of divisions?
2011-07-30 18:00:25	@telemachus	ouch
2011-07-30 18:00:36	dbb0	not a whole semester
2011-07-30 18:00:57	@telemachus	ah, ok
2011-07-30 18:02:21	dbb0	example: what is the ones digit of 13^12
2011-07-30 18:03:47	dbb0	greatest common denominator of n, the extended euclidean algorithm, 5x-1==12(mod22)
2011-07-30 18:03:57	dbb0	all uses %
2011-07-30 18:04:18	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-30 18:04:24	dbb0	use, i should say
2011-07-30 18:04:39	@telemachus	Alright, I need to get this thing some juice and me some food
2011-07-30 18:05:13	@telemachus	Have a good night
2011-07-30 18:07:27	dbb0	later

2011-07-31 12:27:21	fsmithred	hi
2011-07-31 12:27:21	@telemachus	was afk - doing laundry
2011-07-31 12:27:26	fsmithred	again?
2011-07-31 12:27:28	fsmithred	still?
2011-07-31 12:27:31	fsmithred	big load?
2011-07-31 12:27:56	@telemachus	hi
2011-07-31 12:28:04	@telemachus	yesterday I took clothes to dry cleaners
2011-07-31 12:28:13	@telemachus	today we are doing laundry in the building
2011-07-31 12:28:18	@telemachus	fun never ends
2011-07-31 12:28:54	fsmithred	you got kids?
2011-07-31 12:30:41	@telemachus	no sir
2011-07-31 12:30:44	@telemachus	just me and the wife
2011-07-31 12:31:01	@telemachus	but we're exercising a lot and so I'm going through clothes like crazy, lol
2011-07-31 12:31:01	fsmithred	ok, so it's actually possible to catch up on the laundry
2011-07-31 12:31:12	fsmithred	exercise naked
2011-07-31 12:31:38	@telemachus	we do that too
2011-07-31 12:31:49	@telemachus	it's aerobic after all
2011-07-31 12:32:04	@telemachus	but I'm trying to lose weight, so other exercise is also called for
2011-07-31 12:32:15	fsmithred	omg, my housemate just dropped a couple of boxes on my bed and said "Show me how to use this."
2011-07-31 12:32:37	fsmithred	clear skies software for computer-controlled telescope
2011-07-31 12:32:43	fsmithred	and the telescope
2011-07-31 12:33:12	fsmithred	she claims we can see footprints on the moon with it
2011-07-31 12:33:42	@telemachus	wow
2011-07-31 12:33:45	@telemachus	that's awesome
2011-07-31 12:33:49	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-31 12:34:02	fsmithred	I don't think there are any footprints on the moon, but I'll bet we can see trash
2011-07-31 12:34:16	@telemachus	heh
2011-07-31 12:34:23	@telemachus	well, you can settle that question, at least
2011-07-31 12:34:28	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-31 12:37:34	fsmithred	so I got a question about yesterdays script
2011-07-31 12:37:55	fsmithred	is there an easier way to deal with substituting variable numbers of leading spaces?
2011-07-31 12:38:19	fsmithred	forget about html for now
2011-07-31 12:38:40	fsmithred	assume I want to replace each leading space with the letter "J"
2011-07-31 12:39:20	@telemachus	ok, can you give me the pastie again?
2011-07-31 12:39:36	fsmithred	s/^\s\b/&nbsp;/g;
2011-07-31 12:39:45	fsmithred	s/^\s\b/J/g;
2011-07-31 12:40:00	fsmithred	s/^\s\s\b/JJ/g;
2011-07-31 12:40:03	fsmithred	and so on
2011-07-31 12:41:10	@telemachus	hmm, I might use a regex and then tr
2011-07-31 12:41:32	@telemachus	hmm, maybe not...
2011-07-31 12:41:35	fsmithred	some shortcut for "I want to replace n through nn number of spaces with the same number of some character
2011-07-31 12:42:16	@telemachus	right
2011-07-31 12:45:43	@telemachus	I think best is to make it two steps
2011-07-31 12:46:19	fsmithred	count them first?
2011-07-31 12:46:23	@telemachus	(1) count them
2011-07-31 12:46:36	@telemachus	(2) replace \s+ with 'J' * $count
2011-07-31 12:46:38	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-31 12:46:53	fsmithred	thanks, that sounds like it would work
2011-07-31 12:46:54	@telemachus	you could also do a while loop, I suppose
2011-07-31 12:47:44	@telemachus	while (m/^(\s)\b) { s/^(\s)/J/ }
2011-07-31 12:47:56	@telemachus	but I think counting is probably clearer/faster
2011-07-31 12:48:13	fsmithred	with that while loop...
2011-07-31 12:48:29	fsmithred	after you substitute the first space
2011-07-31 12:48:32	fsmithred	are you stuck?
2011-07-31 12:48:48	@telemachus	brb, sorry
2011-07-31 12:48:51	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-31 12:48:54	fsmithred	me too
2011-07-31 12:48:56	fsmithred	gotta pee

2011-07-31 12:53:42	fsmithred	hi
2011-07-31 12:53:48	fsmithred	I got delayed
2011-07-31 12:53:55	nadir	ah, foo.
2011-07-31 12:53:57	fsmithred	had to help friend log into her laptop
2011-07-31 12:54:04	nadir	well: i am late for an hour....
2011-07-31 12:54:15	fsmithred	installed refracta on it yesterday
2011-07-31 12:54:15	nadir	was asleep, just awoke :-)
2011-07-31 12:54:19	nadir	foo.
2011-07-31 12:54:21	fsmithred	good morning
2011-07-31 12:54:25	nadir	yup.
2011-07-31 12:54:26	fsmithred	yeah, but...
2011-07-31 12:54:31	fsmithred	didn't want to mess with mbr
2011-07-31 12:54:42	fsmithred	because she doesn't have windows install disk
2011-07-31 12:54:51	fsmithred	so I made a grub boot cd
2011-07-31 12:55:01	fsmithred	then today, her dvd drive won't spin up
2011-07-31 12:55:12	fsmithred	so I booted it for her with my usb stick
2011-07-31 12:55:26	fsmithred	hm...
2011-07-31 12:55:30	fsmithred	I smell horse manure

2011-07-31 12:56:08	fsmithred	shit
2011-07-31 12:56:11	nadir	oh
2011-07-31 12:56:26	fsmithred	nicer name for it
2011-07-31 12:56:29	nadir	is it a saying, or for real?
2011-07-31 12:56:37	fsmithred	in case you want to put it in your garden
2011-07-31 12:56:40	fsmithred	for real
2011-07-31 12:56:44	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-31 12:56:45	fsmithred	could be
2011-07-31 12:56:48	nadir	i thought...
2011-07-31 12:56:52	fsmithred	someone down the road has horses
2011-07-31 12:57:04	fsmithred	maybe the wind is just right today
2011-07-31 12:57:38	fsmithred	"I smell bullshit"
2011-07-31 12:57:45	fsmithred	that's a saying
2011-07-31 12:58:05	fsmithred	bullshit=lies
2011-07-31 12:58:20	fsmithred	or exaggeration
2011-07-31 12:58:26	nadir	aha.
2011-07-31 12:58:34	nadir	thought something like that. ...
2011-07-31 12:58:39	nadir	hence my confusion.
2011-07-31 12:58:44	fsmithred	lol, sorry
2011-07-31 12:58:50	nadir	np
2011-07-31 12:58:54	nadir	happens .
2011-07-31 12:58:59	nadir	did you get my mail?
2011-07-31 12:59:04	fsmithred	yes, and I replied
2011-07-31 12:59:07	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-31 12:59:23	fsmithred	haven't tried pyblosxom yet
2011-07-31 12:59:25	nadir	no biggie, but i try to avoid the big email-providers.
2011-07-31 12:59:29	fsmithred	got sidetracked on other stuff
2011-07-31 12:59:31	nadir	need to move stuff around.
2011-07-31 12:59:34	fsmithred	trying to rotate a video
2011-07-31 12:59:35	nadir	it is very similar.
2011-07-31 12:59:47	nadir	well: lets say: the same.
2011-07-31 13:00:15	fsmithred	the same except there are actually some people besides us using it?
2011-07-31 13:00:28	nadir	like i wrote: i took your notes to get it running.
2011-07-31 13:00:56	nadir	that i don't know, but it is listed at python.org, it has plugins (?), and irc-channel...
2011-07-31 13:00:59	nadir	so: it might be.
2011-07-31 13:01:11	fsmithred	cool
2011-07-31 13:01:15	nadir	I only want to store notes.  i guess for me it does not matter.
2011-07-31 13:01:17	fsmithred	I'll get to it
2011-07-31 13:01:30	nadir	ah, and you get the atom/rss/whatever feed at the top
2011-07-31 13:01:32	fsmithred	some plugins that work would be nice
2011-07-31 13:01:50	fsmithred	never played with rss
2011-07-31 13:02:06	nadir	not sure what it is. lifereay is rss?
2011-07-31 13:02:15	nadir	ah, duh, i am so clueless...
2011-07-31 13:02:38	@telemachus	I'm back
2011-07-31 13:02:45	nadir	foo telemachus
2011-07-31 13:02:47	fsmithred	I think I've seen it working in kaz once or twice - hover mouse pointer over the link, and the latest headlines show up
2011-07-31 13:02:58	@telemachus	fsmithred: Yes, you're right about the regex not working after the first time
2011-07-31 13:03:01	@telemachus	I'm a dope
2011-07-31 13:03:03	@telemachus	foo foo
2011-07-31 13:03:12	nadir	ah. quote: "Sir. No, Sir. Thanks, but no"
2011-07-31 13:03:20	fsmithred	yeah, I already thought about something like that earlier
2011-07-31 13:03:57	dbb0	if you want to do multiple operations on the same line, you'll need a while loop
2011-07-31 13:04:10	fsmithred	or until loop
2011-07-31 13:04:18	fsmithred	until \b
2011-07-31 13:04:22	fsmithred	I think
2011-07-31 13:04:23	dbb0	until is just negated while
2011-07-31 13:04:49	@telemachus	right, but if you only want them at the start of the line, then it gets tricky
2011-07-31 13:05:01	fsmithred	yeah, I only want to replace all leading spaces
2011-07-31 13:05:08	fsmithred	and as soon as you replace the first one
2011-07-31 13:05:10	@telemachus	m/^(J+)?\s\b/ ...
2011-07-31 13:05:15	fsmithred	the rest are not leading
2011-07-31 13:05:22	@telemachus	that would do it maybe
2011-07-31 13:05:25	@telemachus	start of line
2011-07-31 13:05:28	@telemachus	then one or more J
2011-07-31 13:05:30	@telemachus	then \s
2011-07-31 13:05:31	@telemachus	then \b
2011-07-31 13:05:35	@telemachus	but that gets ugly
2011-07-31 13:05:40	@telemachus	count and replace is probably easier
2011-07-31 13:05:48	fsmithred	and safer
2011-07-31 13:06:04	fsmithred	good thing I don't really need to do this
2011-07-31 13:06:27	dbb0	all leading spaces? /^\s+/
2011-07-31 13:06:49	fsmithred	yeah, and replace them with the same number of some other character
2011-07-31 13:07:05	dbb0	so
2011-07-31 13:07:19	@telemachus	is the replace with specific number that's tricky I think, dbb0
2011-07-31 13:07:56	dbb0	if ( /^(\s+)/ ) { my $space = $1; my @list = join '', $space; ...
2011-07-31 13:07:57	@telemachus	because you can't say s/^\s+\b/J/g
2011-07-31 13:08:53	fsmithred	what's $1 there?
2011-07-31 13:09:00	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-31 13:09:09	dbb0	then map $_ to J
2011-07-31 13:09:27	dbb0	$1 is the first set of parentheses
2011-07-31 13:09:31	@telemachus	why not just if (/^(\s+)\b) { my $count = length($1)... }
2011-07-31 13:09:54	@telemachus	and then substitute with 'J' * $count
2011-07-31 13:09:55	fsmithred	oh, that one I understand
2011-07-31 13:10:03	@telemachus	that's what i had in mind
2011-07-31 13:11:51	fsmithred	anyone feel like explaining how to use map?
2011-07-31 13:12:05	fsmithred	I tried it in a recent script, and I failed
2011-07-31 13:12:12	dbb0	http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/map.html
2011-07-31 13:12:15	@telemachus	sure
2011-07-31 13:12:26	fsmithred	yeah, I've read perldoc -f map
2011-07-31 13:12:35	fsmithred	still don't get it
2011-07-31 13:12:39	@telemachus	map takes a list, performs an operation on each member of the list and then returns a new list made of the results of the operations
2011-07-31 13:12:44	@telemachus	so for example
2011-07-31 13:13:02	@telemachus	my @doubles = map { $_ * 2 } (1..100)
2011-07-31 13:13:33	@telemachus	@doubles gets 2, 4, 6, etc.
2011-07-31 13:13:46	dbb0	perl -le '@a=qw/a b c/; @b=map{ $_="b"} @a; print "$_ " for @b'
2011-07-31 13:13:57	@telemachus	because each item in the list becomes $_ inside the map block and is multipled by 2
2011-07-31 13:14:13	@telemachus	and then the result of that multiplication ends up in the new list
2011-07-31 13:15:54	@telemachus	fsmithred: Did any of that help?
2011-07-31 13:15:59	fsmithred	makes sense when you explain it, but I couldn't do it when I tried
2011-07-31 13:16:08	fsmithred	https://github.com/fsmithred/perl/blob/35ce98796c9d241fb948d54f371c2879d24b0385/add_pics_to_html_map1.pl
2011-07-31 13:16:10	dbb0	in mathematical terms, it defines an isomorphism between sets
2011-07-31 13:16:14	fsmithred	line 100 or so
2011-07-31 13:18:35	@telemachus	you're trying to get just the filename, yes?
2011-07-31 13:18:42	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-31 13:19:27	fsmithred	it's returning the filenames plus the number of times each filename is found
2011-07-31 13:19:50	fsmithred	and then the 1's are getting links that don't really exist
2011-07-31 13:19:54	@telemachus	it's the comma
2011-07-31 13:20:00	@telemachus	you want a semi-colon there
2011-07-31 13:20:01	@telemachus	not a comma
2011-07-31 13:20:11	@telemachus	the comma says "return these two things"
2011-07-31 13:20:18	fsmithred	ah
2011-07-31 13:20:20	@telemachus	the first of which is a count (1) for the replacement
2011-07-31 13:20:30	@telemachus	a semicolon would say: first do this; then return this
2011-07-31 13:21:14	@telemachus	but either way, perhaps use File::Basename :) http://perldoc.perl.org/File/Basename.html
2011-07-31 13:23:12	fsmithred	yeah, that's what I settled on
2011-07-31 13:23:19	fsmithred	and it works the way I want
2011-07-31 13:23:30	fsmithred	https://github.com/fsmithred/perl/blob/35ce98796c9d241fb948d54f371c2879d24b0385/add_pics_to_html_basename.pl
2011-07-31 13:24:57	@telemachus	https://gist.github.com/1116989
2011-07-31 13:25:46	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-31 13:25:54	@telemachus	but in any case, your problem was the comma
2011-07-31 13:26:10	@telemachus	here's how to remember it: inside { } you are giving map a "block"
2011-07-31 13:26:27	@telemachus	a block is a series of statements and those are separated by ; not ,
2011-07-31 13:26:34	fsmithred	oh, that helps
2011-07-31 13:27:07	@telemachus	the _last_ statement is the return value of the block (just like of a subroutine) and that is what ends up in the new array made by map
2011-07-31 13:27:26	@telemachus	what you were doing was returning a _list_ (since , is the list operator
2011-07-31 13:27:30	dbb0	i believe that's one of the traps for c-to-perl programmers
2011-07-31 13:27:43	@telemachus	dbb0: Which part?
2011-07-31 13:27:49	dbb0	last
2011-07-31 13:28:09	@telemachus	returning implicitly on final statement?
2011-07-31 13:28:13	dbb0	i didn't read the whole thing
2011-07-31 13:28:39	dbb0	i was talking about break vs last
2011-07-31 13:28:51	@telemachus	gotcha
2011-07-31 13:28:52	dbb0	my bad
2011-07-31 13:28:52	@telemachus	brb
2011-07-31 13:29:56	dbb0	nadir: did you set your search up
2011-07-31 13:30:11	nadir	nope.
2011-07-31 13:30:15	dbb0	?
2011-07-31 13:30:26	nadir	i was fiddling with the blog-machine.
2011-07-31 13:30:32	nadir	i got it on my plan.
2011-07-31 13:30:39	dbb0	ah, distracted
2011-07-31 13:30:51	nadir	my main problem is: i want to search my site. i don't want to search anything else.
2011-07-31 13:30:57	nadir	that is a bit confusing for me.
2011-07-31 13:31:08	dbb0	yeah, the DDG search has an option for that
2011-07-31 13:31:15	nadir	ah. good.
2011-07-31 13:31:24	nadir	it might take months, but i will do it.
2011-07-31 13:32:00	nadir	so: thanks for the tip, again.
2011-07-31 13:32:25	nadir	i even looked at ddg, but did not understand all (via www, that is)
2011-07-31 13:33:36	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1116998
2011-07-31 13:34:28	nadir	tnx
2011-07-31 13:37:01	nadir	but it does not show up, there must be more to it...
2011-07-31 13:38:41	fsmithred	I get a search box, but it turns up no results
2011-07-31 13:39:13	nadir	you probably need to replace =MYSITE with the real name
2011-07-31 13:39:25	fsmithred	debian site:resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-31 13:39:35	fsmithred	that's in the ddg search box
2011-07-31 13:39:59	fsmithred	but it says "no results. try google/bing/more..."
2011-07-31 13:40:13	fsmithred	robots.txt?
2011-07-31 13:40:42	dbb0	site:foo is  google-specific syntax
2011-07-31 13:40:47	dbb0	ddg uses !site
2011-07-31 13:41:28	fsmithred	search box moved, but now I can't type anything into it
2011-07-31 13:41:39	fsmithred	and FWIW, it's just a plain white box
2011-07-31 13:45:40	fsmithred	site:foo works for me a ddg
2011-07-31 13:46:32	fsmithred	now nadir's search box is gone
2011-07-31 13:47:20	nadir	hu?
2011-07-31 13:47:27	nadir	my search box? wtf?
2011-07-31 13:47:35	fsmithred	it's gone
2011-07-31 13:47:41	nadir	wherer was it?
2011-07-31 13:47:52	fsmithred	first it was under "Powered by 'Debian..."
2011-07-31 13:48:00	fsmithred	and it worked, but ddg got no results
2011-07-31 13:48:07	nadir	to fuck with me. Why was it there for you, but not for me?
2011-07-31 13:48:12	nadir	and, btw, i removed it again.
2011-07-31 13:48:15	fsmithred	then it moved up under "misc stuff" and I couldn't type anything in it.
2011-07-31 13:48:19	nadir	so it is clear why it is gone for you.
2011-07-31 13:48:19	fsmithred	now it's gone
2011-07-31 13:48:26	fsmithred	ok, yeah
2011-07-31 13:48:32	nadir	what is not clear is why it was never there for me.
2011-07-31 13:48:38	dbb0	fsmithred: https://gist.github.com/1117012
2011-07-31 13:48:48	nadir	i did the same at misc.html, and there it showed up.
2011-07-31 13:49:14	dbb0	that way you can use google tricks without the tracking cookies/ads
2011-07-31 13:49:36	dbb0	change site:MY_SITE to whatever
2011-07-31 13:52:13	fsmithred	nadir, maybe you just needed to scroll down - it was at the bottom
2011-07-31 13:52:14	nadir	i would lilke to skipp the whole redirection.
2011-07-31 13:52:20	nadir	i want to search my site, and that is all.
2011-07-31 13:52:47	nadir	if that will not work i will add something like duckduck...
2011-07-31 13:53:16	nadir	with the code you gave above
2011-07-31 13:53:43	fsmithred	cgi script that uses grep?
2011-07-31 13:54:11	nadir	no clue yet. i found it somewhere, but missed to bookmark it. I think it used a wiki-search-engine.
2011-07-31 13:54:23	nadir	a one-liner similar to what dbb0 posted above
2011-07-31 13:54:50	dbb0	you don't want run a search engine on your own server
2011-07-31 13:54:54	fsmithred	maybe you can find it in browser history
2011-07-31 13:55:09	dbb0	especially one that uses perl/grep
2011-07-31 13:55:24	fsmithred	why not?
2011-07-31 13:56:53	dbb0	let's say some clown decides to write a simple shell script that uses curl to repeatedly perform junk form posts to your search in an infinite loop
2011-07-31 13:57:07	nadir	aha, there it is.
2011-07-31 13:57:07	dbb0	serious overload
2011-07-31 13:57:09	nadir	a miracle.
2011-07-31 13:57:34	dbb0	if it's not a computer for which you are liable, knock yourself out
2011-07-31 13:57:55	fsmithred	heh, and piss off someone else
2011-07-31 13:58:03	fsmithred	nadir, I can't type in the box
2011-07-31 13:58:07	dbb0	i just think it's a bad idea to use your own resources to do a job that can easily be outsourced
2011-07-31 13:58:26	dbb0	especially when said job is a potential risk
2011-07-31 13:58:35	fsmithred	makes sense
2011-07-31 13:58:47	nadir	i can type
2011-07-31 13:58:52	dbb0	did you try the scroogle example i posted?
2011-07-31 13:59:36	nadir	no
2011-07-31 13:59:49	dbb0	i mean fsmithred 
2011-07-31 13:59:57	dbb0	he was using site:foo earlier
2011-07-31 13:59:59	fsmithred	no
2011-07-31 14:00:03	nadir	ah.
2011-07-31 14:00:04	fsmithred	how do I use it?
2011-07-31 14:00:27	dbb0	just plop the html into your page wherever you want a search box
2011-07-31 14:00:36	dbb0	probably in <header> or so
2011-07-31 14:00:37	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-31 14:00:44	fsmithred	site is turned off right now
2011-07-31 14:00:54	fsmithred	but I saved the code
2011-07-31 14:00:59	dbb0	you can remove the radio buttons too if they aren't useful
2011-07-31 14:01:12	fsmithred	thanks; I'll play with it
2011-07-31 14:01:23	dbb0	that's just the code from https://ssl.scroogle.org/
2011-07-31 14:01:35	fsmithred	right now I want to know why I can't type in nadir's search box
2011-07-31 14:01:42	dbb0	https + ssl = good
2011-07-31 14:01:50	dbb0	what search box is that
2011-07-31 14:02:02	fsmithred	the one that just disappeared from his page again
2011-07-31 14:02:15	dbb0	i need to see the html
2011-07-31 14:02:18	nadir	i removed it.
2011-07-31 14:02:29	dbb0	...
2011-07-31 14:02:30	nadir	<iframe src="http://duckduckgo.com/search.html?width=200&site=YOURSITE" style="overflow:hidden;margin:0;padding:0;width:248px;height:38px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
2011-07-31 14:03:29	dbb0	what site do you want to search
2011-07-31 14:03:44	nadir	my site. like said.
2011-07-31 14:03:46	nadir	and my site only
2011-07-31 14:03:49	dbb0	url?
2011-07-31 14:03:58	nadir	resident.dyndns.info
2011-07-31 14:04:46	dbb0	i can type in it just fine
2011-07-31 14:05:19	dbb0	but it's not going to find anything unless site= a valid url
2011-07-31 14:06:24	dbb0	nadir: my guess is that your site is not indexed by ddg
2011-07-31 14:06:33	nadir	yup
2011-07-31 14:06:33	dbb0	fsmithred: i was wrong, site:foo works on DDG
2011-07-31 14:06:54	fsmithred	maybe they changed it since you last tried
2011-07-31 14:07:08	fsmithred	I just started using them recently
2011-07-31 14:07:22	fsmithred	what I miss is cached pages with highlighted search terms
2011-07-31 14:07:52	dbb0	even google doesn't find anything on nadirs site
2011-07-31 14:07:54	dbb0	http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl
2011-07-31 14:09:31	nadir	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fresident.dyndns.info
2011-07-31 14:10:15	dbb0	those are generic results
2011-07-31 14:10:28	dbb0	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffake.site
2011-07-31 14:11:45	dbb0	do you really think that there will be so much stuff on your site that visitors will need a search?
2011-07-31 14:12:10	fsmithred	I'm guessing he wants it for his own use
2011-07-31 14:12:32	dbb0	well, since he has access to the server, find/locate should work
2011-07-31 14:12:35	nadir	well: if i keep all the bookmarks in mind, i think a searchengine will not be bad
2011-07-31 14:12:50	dbb0	a site map might be helpful in any case
2011-07-31 14:14:13	dbb0	nadir: for bookmarks, try delicious
2011-07-31 14:14:25	dbb0	or pinboard.in
2011-07-31 14:14:55	nadir	and there i can search?
2011-07-31 14:15:14	dbb0	you can search the things you add
2011-07-31 14:15:25	dbb0	http://www.delicious.com/dbb008
2011-07-31 14:15:27	dbb0	example
2011-07-31 14:15:42	dbb0	the tags are helpful
2011-07-31 14:16:05	dbb0	pinboard.in is less cluttered but it's a pay service
2011-07-31 14:16:18	nadir	yes, very cluttered.
2011-07-31 14:16:23	nadir	and that are a few bookmarks only
2011-07-31 14:16:44	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-31 14:16:50	nadir	will have a look anyway.
2011-07-31 14:17:38	dbb0	tele's pinboard: http://pinboard.in/u:telemachus
2011-07-31 14:18:20	nadir	i would want bookmarks to be sorted by subject. say:
2011-07-31 14:18:21	nadir	perl
2011-07-31 14:18:22	nadir	python
2011-07-31 14:18:23	nadir	git
2011-07-31 14:18:25	nadir	C
2011-07-31 14:18:27	nadir	so on
2011-07-31 14:18:28	@telemachus	nadir: They are
2011-07-31 14:18:43	@telemachus	http://pinboard.in/u:telemachus/t:perl
2011-07-31 14:18:51	dbb0	nadir: that's what tags are for
2011-07-31 14:18:52	@telemachus	http://pinboard.in/u:telemachus/t:bash
2011-07-31 14:19:06	@telemachus	http://pinboard.in/u:telemachus/t:vim
2011-07-31 14:19:11	nadir	aha
2011-07-31 14:19:26	dbb0	http://www.delicious.com/dbb008/perl
2011-07-31 14:19:28	@telemachus	 /t:<foo> is for tagged with foo
2011-07-31 14:19:34	@telemachus	on Pinboard
2011-07-31 14:19:41	@telemachus	right, delicious has prettier URLs
2011-07-31 14:19:52	nadir	the tag-thing is not really my thing.
2011-07-31 14:19:56	dbb0	...
2011-07-31 14:20:03	@telemachus	nadir: It's just a way of grouping items
2011-07-31 14:20:12	@telemachus	as you said "sorted by subject"
2011-07-31 14:20:15	@telemachus	tags does that
2011-07-31 14:20:33	nadir	yes.
2011-07-31 14:20:35	nadir	i know.
2011-07-31 14:20:41	nadir	i mean very old century like
2011-07-31 14:20:47	dbb0	?
2011-07-31 14:21:05	nadir	i click on bookmarks, go to bookmarks
2011-07-31 14:21:12	nadir	i click on git, go to the git bookmarks
2011-07-31 14:21:25	nadir	a place where i can visually see it all sorted.
2011-07-31 14:21:35	@telemachus	nadir: Did you go to my main page?
2011-07-31 14:21:37	nadir	not a tag, and i say tag:git, and ...
2011-07-31 14:21:37	@telemachus	It has that
2011-07-31 14:21:45	@telemachus	clickable links to tag groups
2011-07-31 14:22:02	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/content/computing.content/bookmarks.html
2011-07-31 14:22:12	nadir	now let me search for your start page, second.
2011-07-31 14:22:20	@telemachus	http://cl.ly/8uHg
2011-07-31 14:22:27	@telemachus	Stuff on the right is clickable links
2011-07-31 14:22:34	dbb0	there's nothing i hate more than a GTK menu, particularly when filled with several levels of directories
2011-07-31 14:23:15	nadir	yup, that i know, and i for one can't deal with it.
2011-07-31 14:23:21	nadir	i know that as tags
2011-07-31 14:23:24	dbb0	hey, let's try to navigate the mouse through a 15 pixel wide channel back and forth
2011-07-31 14:23:51	nadir	ask.debian.net has it. i think all shapado (sp) services.
2011-07-31 14:24:01	nadir	its not my thing. I don't say its bad, but i can't handle it.
2011-07-31 14:24:29	dbb0	then what do you want exactly
2011-07-31 14:24:31	dbb0	a tree?
2011-07-31 14:24:35	nadir	yup.
2011-07-31 14:24:41	nadir	and my prefered number is 3
2011-07-31 14:24:55	nadir	as deep down as possible.
2011-07-31 14:25:01	dbb0	https://sites.google.com/site/danielbarrettbolton/links
2011-07-31 14:25:01	nadir	Foo
2011-07-31 14:25:07	nadir	FooA FooB FooC
2011-07-31 14:25:09	dbb0	something like that maybe
2011-07-31 14:25:16	nadir	FooA1 FooA2 FooA3
2011-07-31 14:25:40	@telemachus	dbb0: That page is not open
2011-07-31 14:26:15	dbb0	oh yeah, i made it private after a certain person from the DUF started harassing me
2011-07-31 14:26:23	fsmithred	back
2011-07-31 14:26:40	@telemachus	wb

2011-07-31 14:28:15	dbb0	anyway, it's basically a nested list
2011-07-31 14:28:31	@telemachus	right
2011-07-31 14:29:25	dbb0	i think maybe that's what nadir wanted
2011-07-31 14:29:55	nadir	well: i showed the link, and to me its obvious that that is what i want.
2011-07-31 14:30:09	nadir	what i for one don't want is something like 180 tags
2011-07-31 14:30:33	nadir	it is hip, i know, probably its good, but its not my thing.
2011-07-31 14:30:55	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-31 14:30:55	@telemachus	probably easier for a human to build that than a machine
2011-07-31 14:30:55	@telemachus	nadir: huh?
2011-07-31 14:31:20	nadir	what huh?
2011-07-31 14:31:40	@telemachus	< nadir> well: i showed the link, and to me its obvious that that is  what i want.
2011-07-31 14:31:45	@telemachus	That was my "huh?"
2011-07-31 14:31:51	nadir	ok, i will show the link again:
2011-07-31 14:32:03	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/content/computing.content/bookmarks.html
2011-07-31 14:32:24	nadir	now compare that with the png send by dbb0 and you will see that it is obvious that the main idea
2011-07-31 14:32:30	nadir	behind them is pretty much the same.
2011-07-31 14:32:40	nadir	especially when compared with the tagging method.
2011-07-31 14:33:00	nadir	there is obviously a difference in the general approach.
2011-07-31 14:33:03	@telemachus	yup
2011-07-31 14:33:04	@telemachus	that probably requires a human to make that
2011-07-31 14:33:27	nadir	well: i got one, here. i will use him for that... :-)
2011-07-31 14:33:33	dbb0	http://www.thecssninja.com/css/css-tree-menu
2011-07-31 14:33:38	dbb0	pretty cool
2011-07-31 14:35:56	dbb0	but would take even longer to build
2011-07-31 14:37:08	@telemachus	Right
2011-07-31 14:37:31	@telemachus	FOr me the advantage of Pinboard/Delicious are (1) lots less work for me and (2) the ability to do very complex searches
2011-07-31 14:37:39	@telemachus	like perl AND vim
2011-07-31 14:37:58	nadir	i see, and i have assumed something like that.
2011-07-31 14:38:10	nadir	i am horny when it comes to the number 3
2011-07-31 14:38:15	@telemachus	um
2011-07-31 14:38:17	@telemachus	huh?
2011-07-31 14:38:25	nadir	I love the tree approach
2011-07-31 14:38:37	nadir	and, as i am German, i usually use the number 3
2011-07-31 14:38:48	nadir	a root. And all after that is 3
2011-07-31 14:39:21	nadir	open any book by Kant. you will see it sorted by 3, same for Hegel... etc
2011-07-31 14:39:50	nadir	the table of contents. that is.
2011-07-31 14:39:57	nadir	now open, say Dewey. No 3 there.
2011-07-31 14:40:19	dbb0	do you mean each class has 3 members
2011-07-31 14:40:25	nadir	yup.
2011-07-31 14:40:37	dbb0	that just seems extremely arbitrary
2011-07-31 14:40:39	nadir	Foo Foo1 Foo2 Foo3...
2011-07-31 14:40:43	nadir	no, it is not.
2011-07-31 14:40:54	nadir	the father, the sun, and the holy big bang.
2011-07-31 14:41:19	nadir	Hegel even removed some continents to keep the 3
2011-07-31 14:41:20	@telemachus	nadir: I like you, but I think you're cracked.
2011-07-31 14:41:26	@telemachus	You and all the German trio-lovers
2011-07-31 14:41:27	@telemachus	:)
2011-07-31 14:41:31	dbb0	so 3 is less arbitrary than any other integer
2011-07-31 14:41:41	nadir	that might be, but the good thing is:
2011-07-31 14:41:59	nadir	you open the table of content, and at one glance you know what is where, and why it is there.
2011-07-31 14:42:23	nadir	If you got two things, you know one is missing.
2011-07-31 14:42:25	fsmithred	yes, three is a magic number
2011-07-31 14:42:29	nadir	Its easy to remember . Its good.
2011-07-31 14:42:36	nadir	4 would be just as good.
2011-07-31 14:42:39	dbb0	the problem of partitioning any set into n subsets is that not all sets have the same cardinality
2011-07-31 14:42:41	nadir	As long it is always like that.
2011-07-31 14:42:41	fsmithred	I learned that in toastmasters
2011-07-31 14:43:03	nadir	Hegel was told that reality would be not conform to his theory. His answer:
2011-07-31 14:43:09	nadir	That is really bad for reality.
2011-07-31 14:43:12	dbb0	and whenever i say any set, i refer to all sets in question
2011-07-31 14:43:13	fsmithred	lol
2011-07-31 14:43:21	@telemachus	shit
2011-07-31 14:43:22	@telemachus	fuck
2011-07-31 14:43:24	@telemachus	laughing too hard
2011-07-31 14:43:25	@telemachus	stop
2011-07-31 14:43:36	@telemachus	my new signature: < nadir> Hegel was told that reality would be not conform to his  theory. His answer:
2011-07-31 14:43:40	@telemachus	14:43:09 < nadir> That is really bad for reality.
2011-07-31 14:43:53	nadir	yeah, the original, in German, is a killer. And he was serious.
2011-07-31 14:43:55	nadir	really.
2011-07-31 14:43:58	nadir	very funny dude.
2011-07-31 14:44:06		[dbb0 away: food]
2011-07-31 14:44:40	@telemachus	I believe that (1) he was serious and (2) that is shit funny
2011-07-31 14:44:41	@telemachus	wow
2011-07-31 14:44:44	@telemachus	just wow
2011-07-31 14:45:00	nadir	its a pitty it takes so fucking long to read it. Its really funny.
2011-07-31 14:45:02	@telemachus	Do you remember where this story is of him saying that?
2011-07-31 14:45:07	nadir	A big clown
2011-07-31 14:45:16	nadir	I read it at Adorno.
2011-07-31 14:45:17	@telemachus	Hegel I never managed to read more than 5 or 10 pages at a stretch
2011-07-31 14:45:26	nadir	"Anmerkungen zu Hegel"
2011-07-31 14:45:28	@telemachus	foul ugly writer (in English at least)
2011-07-31 14:45:29	@telemachus	ah, k
2011-07-31 14:45:44	nadir	but its a waste of time.
2011-07-31 14:46:29	nadir	but, more serious, i am really touchy when it comes to trees.
2011-07-31 14:46:35	@telemachus	trees or threes?
2011-07-31 14:46:35	nadir	i am used to the 3
2011-07-31 14:46:40	@telemachus	or threes of trees?
2011-07-31 14:46:41	nadir	both.
2011-07-31 14:46:45	@telemachus	you know
2011-07-31 14:46:48	@telemachus	at cavalry
2011-07-31 14:46:53	@telemachus	weren't there three thieves
2011-07-31 14:46:56	@telemachus	also with him?
2011-07-31 14:46:58	nadir	I try to sort it like that. Its in me.
2011-07-31 14:46:58	@telemachus	or was he the third
2011-07-31 14:47:00	@telemachus	of three
2011-07-31 14:47:16	@telemachus	crazy christians and their three trees
2011-07-31 14:47:21	nadir	a tree of thieves with three ..
2011-07-31 14:47:42	nadir	another simple example:
2011-07-31 14:48:08	nadir	criticism of pure reason, criticism of practical reason, criticism of "Urteilskraf"
2011-07-31 14:48:10	nadir	3
2011-07-31 14:48:12	nadir	see?
2011-07-31 14:48:19	nadir	always and ever.
2011-07-31 14:48:47	@telemachus	um
2011-07-31 14:48:52	@telemachus	yeah
2011-07-31 14:48:57	@telemachus	question
2011-07-31 14:49:06	@telemachus	can you find some non-German, non-crazy people examples?
2011-07-31 14:49:10	@telemachus	Just saying. :)
2011-07-31 14:49:12	nadir	no.
2011-07-31 14:49:16	@telemachus	Hume - two Treatises
2011-07-31 14:49:18	@telemachus	not three
2011-07-31 14:49:19	nadir	i don't care for non Germans.
2011-07-31 14:49:21	nadir	fuck Hume
2011-07-31 14:49:23	@telemachus	and two Enquiries
2011-07-31 14:49:35	nadir	Bacon, Locke, Hume
2011-07-31 14:49:36	nadir	three.
2011-07-31 14:49:36	@telemachus	Plato, tetralogies not triads
2011-07-31 14:49:50	nadir	Sokrates, Platon, Aristoteles.
2011-07-31 14:49:51	nadir	3
2011-07-31 14:50:02	nadir	ha ha ha..
2011-07-31 14:50:02	@telemachus	no, it's Hobbes, Bacon, Locke, Berkeley, Hume
2011-07-31 14:50:12	nadir	that is just plain wrong.
2011-07-31 14:50:13	@telemachus	That second one, I'll give you
2011-07-31 14:50:20	@telemachus	also three tragedians
2011-07-31 14:50:30	@telemachus	Aeschylus, Socrates, Euripides
2011-07-31 14:50:33	nadir	well: those are from the island. There can't be reason.
2011-07-31 14:50:46	nadir	Kant, the godfather himself, and then:
2011-07-31 14:50:56	nadir	Fichte, Scheling, Hegel.
2011-07-31 14:51:04	@telemachus	hmm
2011-07-31 14:51:04	nadir	always three.
2011-07-31 14:51:06	@telemachus	that's four
2011-07-31 14:51:07	nadir	no kidding.
2011-07-31 14:51:08	@telemachus	huh?
2011-07-31 14:51:10	nadir	no.
2011-07-31 14:51:14	@telemachus	kant
2011-07-31 14:51:16	@telemachus	fichte
2011-07-31 14:51:21	nadir	the father, the sun, the holy big bang.
2011-07-31 14:51:26	nadir	all three are god.
2011-07-31 14:51:33	nadir	so, Kant himself does not count.
2011-07-31 14:51:37	@telemachus	yeah, see, huh?
2011-07-31 14:51:40	nadir	It is the source itself.
2011-07-31 14:51:56	nadir	the beginning, the end, and the middle of all things.
2011-07-31 14:52:16	nadir	but, i am not kidding.
2011-07-31 14:52:22	nadir	Kant is the end of enlightenment.
2011-07-31 14:52:28	nadir	The other three are German idealism
2011-07-31 14:52:54	nadir	It is a trick, obviiously.
2011-07-31 14:53:03	nadir	As everyone here sorts by three, i sure always got three.
2011-07-31 14:53:07	nadir	It does not prove anything.
2011-07-31 14:54:21	@telemachus	Yah
2011-07-31 14:54:27	@telemachus	We need more non-German examples
2011-07-31 14:54:41	nadir	mhh.... i don't know, that is for sure.
2011-07-31 14:55:42	nadir	so, delicious.
2011-07-31 14:55:47	nadir	I got to check that.
2011-07-31 14:56:59	nadir	(i can go forever with Hegel and such... but i think its done now)
2011-07-31 14:57:45	nadir	and i hope it is clear why i sometimes am stubborn when it comes to solutions.
2011-07-31 14:58:03	@telemachus	Cause the Germans messed you up?
2011-07-31 14:58:09	 *	telemachus hides behind fsmithred 
2011-07-31 14:58:18	nadir	kinda yes.
2011-07-31 14:58:36	nadir	I simple like to sort like that. It helps me, everything else confuses me.
2011-07-31 14:59:37	nadir	say something like (bookmarks): Private, Computing, Entertainment
2011-07-31 14:59:44	nadir	that would help a lot, when it comes to tagging.
2011-07-31 15:00:04	nadir	not those tons of tags at the right side.
2011-07-31 15:00:17	@telemachus	Yeah - short version - I don't know if you can group like that in small groups
2011-07-31 15:01:00	nadir	perhaps i will get used to it (tagging)
2011-07-31 15:04:53	fsmithred	sorry, I was looking for a missing 5lb bag of potatoes
2011-07-31 15:05:08	fsmithred	I saw them get put away a few days ago
2011-07-31 15:05:22	fsmithred	I know I saw her put them in the cabinet near the sink
2011-07-31 15:05:25	fsmithred	now they're gone
2011-07-31 15:05:46	@telemachus	Someone ate em?
2011-07-31 15:05:51	fsmithred	nope
2011-07-31 15:06:02	fsmithred	unless one person at 5lbs when we weren't looking
2011-07-31 15:06:10	nadir	5lb is a bit much to eat in a few days, no?
2011-07-31 15:06:15	fsmithred	ya
2011-07-31 15:08:25	nadir	i hate, hate , hate that if something is there, i am sure,
2011-07-31 15:08:33	nadir	and suddenly it is away.
2011-07-31 15:08:38	nadir	makes me restless
2011-07-31 15:08:42	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-31 15:08:51	fsmithred	seems to be happening more in this house
2011-07-31 15:09:03	fsmithred	owner moved to a tiny house from a 13-room house
2011-07-31 15:09:14	fsmithred	stuff is stuffed all over the place
2011-07-31 15:10:14	fsmithred	I might go crazy soon
2011-07-31 15:10:34	fsmithred	not that I'm the neatest person in the world
2011-07-31 15:10:43	fsmithred	but I like a little bit of order
2011-07-31 15:11:04	fsmithred	not a chinese puzzle just to get a cooking pot off the shelf
2011-07-31 15:11:33	nadir	some things, like cooking, needs to be done, and i like to do them as fast as possible.
2011-07-31 15:12:37	fsmithred	btw
2011-07-31 15:12:46	fsmithred	mencoder -ovc lavc -vf rotate=1 -oac pcm infile.mov  -o outfile.avi
2011-07-31 15:13:01	fsmithred	works great for movie made on iphone held sideways
2011-07-31 15:18:32	nadir	fsmithred, you must tell me how to sort my blogs.
2011-07-31 15:18:40	nadir	say ~/Doc/blog
2011-07-31 15:18:41	fsmithred	sort?
2011-07-31 15:18:51	nadir	i do mkdir private perl html
2011-07-31 15:18:52	fsmithred	make subdirs in $datadir
2011-07-31 15:18:55	nadir	yes.
2011-07-31 15:19:17	fsmithred	anything in a subdir will get an extra link in the permalink
2011-07-31 15:19:20	nadir	do i need to edit foot.hmtl, head.html or something?
2011-07-31 15:19:23	nadir	automatically?
2011-07-31 15:19:31	fsmithred	you click on that extra link, and you'll see everything in that subdir
2011-07-31 15:19:40	fsmithred	all files will show up in the main blog
2011-07-31 15:20:12	fsmithred	but each subdir/extra link will only show the ones in that subdir
2011-07-31 15:20:27	nadir	ok, i will try.
2011-07-31 15:20:33	nadir	I thought there was more to it.
2011-07-31 15:20:33	fsmithred	I made separate ones for um, apache, blosxom, and something else
2011-07-31 15:20:39	fsmithred	nope, it's automatic
2011-07-31 15:21:02	nadir	i added a debian-logo. (proud)
2011-07-31 15:21:29	nadir	if i really store my "how-to do what" there, i will need subdirs.
2011-07-31 15:21:42	nadir	assuming i will use it for long. it will become huge
2011-07-31 15:22:05	nadir	very helpful,
2011-07-31 15:22:07	fsmithred	the config file is set to recurse infinite levels of subdirs
2011-07-31 15:22:18	nadir	say the entry for apache, a2enmod, in default.
2011-07-31 15:22:25	nadir	if i need it, go there ,got it.
2011-07-31 15:24:24	nadir	not to speak of the damn git commands.
2011-07-31 15:25:48	fsmithred	you might want to create a link page just for the blosxom links, eventually
2011-07-31 15:26:18	nadir	ah, yes.
2011-07-31 15:26:19	fsmithred	or find a menu plugin that works
2011-07-31 15:26:27	fsmithred	sidebar menu might be nice
2011-07-31 15:27:21	fsmithred	did you add the links at the top - home, rss, atom?
2011-07-31 15:32:02	nadir	nope, its there out of box
2011-07-31 15:32:19	nadir	sidebar menu might be nice? big fat + one.
2011-07-31 15:41:18	fsmithred	hey nadir, what's the interface name for your wireless on the laptop?
2011-07-31 15:41:52	nadir	none.
2011-07-31 15:41:54	nadir	lol.
2011-07-31 15:41:57	fsmithred	???
2011-07-31 15:42:02	nadir	i pretty much gaveup on wireless.
2011-07-31 15:42:05	fsmithred	no drivers for it?
2011-07-31 15:42:15	nadir	i removed non-free and bought an usb.
2011-07-31 15:42:20	nadir	there it is wlan0 i think
2011-07-31 15:42:24	fsmithred	cool
2011-07-31 15:42:27	nadir	for the build-in it was.. mhhh..
2011-07-31 15:42:30	nadir	i think eth1
2011-07-31 15:42:32	nadir	not sure.
2011-07-31 15:42:34	fsmithred	ew
2011-07-31 15:42:36	nadir	but, for your topic.
2011-07-31 15:42:48	nadir	if you add wlan0, and that is not correct for some:
2011-07-31 15:43:01	fsmithred	they can change it
2011-07-31 15:43:02	nadir	if you would add nothing one has to edit too.
2011-07-31 15:43:06	nadir	I can see no problem
2011-07-31 15:43:08	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-31 15:43:10	nadir	yup. what you said.
2011-07-31 15:43:15	nadir	its a +, and no -
2011-07-31 15:43:17	fsmithred	at least with the wrong interface, you've got an example
2011-07-31 15:43:48	nadir	i would simply add it.
2011-07-31 15:43:52	fsmithred	brb
2011-07-31 15:49:13	fsmithred	back
2011-07-31 15:49:41	nadir	g
2011-07-31 15:55:02	fsmithred	so what's our next perl project?
2011-07-31 15:55:11	nadir	fuck perl
2011-07-31 15:55:13	nadir	:-)
2011-07-31 15:55:14	fsmithred	or should that get put on hold and do refracta?
2011-07-31 15:55:26	nadir	i need to get my head back in perl
2011-07-31 15:55:32	nadir	yesterday i read references.
2011-07-31 15:55:42	nadir	but did no training.
2011-07-31 15:55:45	fsmithred	I read that once
2011-07-31 15:55:47	nadir	for me perl is very hard.
2011-07-31 15:55:52	fsmithred	don't remember any of it
2011-07-31 15:55:53	fsmithred	same here
2011-07-31 15:56:09	fsmithred	I need to roll snapshot into a deb
2011-07-31 15:56:14	nadir	i think i have put it back, to the middle of my list.
2011-07-31 15:56:16	fsmithred	and then do the gui version
2011-07-31 15:56:30	nadir	if i will be able to do perl in, say, 5 years. it is ok.
2011-07-31 15:56:35	nadir	if not, it is ok too.
2011-07-31 15:58:07	nadir	going for refracta is sure a good idea too.
2011-07-31 15:59:39	nadir	and, on a side note, the other (big) problem i got is:
2011-07-31 15:59:51	nadir	i do bash: folks say: "for that perl is better"
2011-07-31 16:00:05	fsmithred	fuck 'em
2011-07-31 16:00:07	nadir	i do perl, folks say: "for that python is better"
2011-07-31 16:00:08	fsmithred	bash rocks
2011-07-31 16:00:12	nadir	that is very frustrating.
2011-07-31 16:00:15	nadir	and yes, bash rocks.
2011-07-31 16:00:26	nadir	i am not sure if the idea to switch to perl was so good.
2011-07-31 16:00:36	nadir	for a certain kind of people, that is.
2011-07-31 16:00:47	nadir	you can do a heck lot with bash.
2011-07-31 16:01:01	fsmithred	well, if you want to focus on that for awhile, I'd be ok with it
2011-07-31 16:01:07	fsmithred	there's a bunch in bash I don't know
2011-07-31 16:01:25	nadir	i could not do the most easy things anymore...
2011-07-31 16:01:39	nadir	i see code, and i often understand.
2011-07-31 16:01:47	nadir	but creating, say, an array. no clue.
2011-07-31 16:01:50	nadir	i need to see it.
2011-07-31 16:02:35	nadir	both, perl and python, are so huge that i get lost in details.
2011-07-31 16:02:42	nadir	without ever getting anywhere.
2011-07-31 16:02:52	nadir	in bash you simply add one command after the other.
2011-07-31 16:02:58	nadir	and it does what you want
2011-07-31 16:03:02	nadir	(well: hopefully)
2011-07-31 16:03:09	fsmithred	pretty much
2011-07-31 16:08:11	nadir	but i say: lets stick to perl for a while.
2011-07-31 16:08:15	nadir	let it sink a bit more.
2011-07-31 16:08:28	nadir	I am still at that shitty beginners guide.
2011-07-31 16:08:41	fsmithred	fred and barney?
2011-07-31 16:08:44	nadir	and probably will stay there for some while.
2011-07-31 16:08:50	nadir	no idea, let me check the name
2011-07-31 16:09:09	nadir	progperl.pdf
2011-07-31 16:09:14	fsmithred	oh, ok
2011-07-31 16:09:23	fsmithred	the australian book
2011-07-31 16:09:24	nadir	if you say: no, no, me wants bash. cool for me.
2011-07-31 16:09:35	nadir	very frustrated.
2011-07-31 16:09:36	nadir	really.
2011-07-31 16:09:37	fsmithred	well, maybe bash for the next couple of weeks for me
2011-07-31 16:09:45	fsmithred	to get snapshot in shape
2011-07-31 16:09:51	fsmithred	and maybe installer
2011-07-31 16:09:55	fsmithred	not sure if that needs anything
2011-07-31 16:09:55	nadir	the non-prorgramming stuff i do is fun, right now. but programming: very frustrating.
2011-07-31 16:10:09	nadir	so, we will run into bash anyway.
2011-07-31 16:10:15	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-31 16:10:24	fsmithred	I'll post stuff that needs to be tested
2011-07-31 16:10:27	nadir	with all my trouble bout snapshot i had to look a lot at the code.
2011-07-31 16:10:37	nadir	as you know i got strange problems.
2011-07-31 16:10:45	fsmithred	I like that dz's version of snapshot does not use terminal at all
2011-07-31 16:10:47	nadir	so i am not a good pig, it seems.
2011-07-31 16:10:55	fsmithred	yeah, that's weird
2011-07-31 16:11:01	nadir	if it fails in general , what can i say?
2011-07-31 16:11:34	fsmithred	I think that most of the times I got a really small iso, it was because the excludes file was wrong
2011-07-31 16:12:25	nadir	that problem is gone now.
2011-07-31 16:12:33	fsmithred	and a bunch of my tests were screwed up because the config file wasn't getting used
2011-07-31 16:12:34	nadir	i run into the booting-> la-la not found
2011-07-31 16:12:49	fsmithred	yeah, I ran into that because of the initrd typo
2011-07-31 16:12:54	fsmithred	it's in two places
2011-07-31 16:13:00	fsmithred	in the main script and in the config file
2011-07-31 16:13:08	nadir	nope, the typo is gone.
2011-07-31 16:13:10	fsmithred	was in two place
2011-07-31 16:13:12	fsmithred	s
2011-07-31 16:13:14	nadir	what?
2011-07-31 16:13:16	nadir	two?
2011-07-31 16:13:24	nadir	well: i git pulled your code...
2011-07-31 16:13:31	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-31 16:13:31	nadir	the new version, that is.
2011-07-31 16:13:46	fsmithred	then just make sure the config file is right
2011-07-31 16:14:28	fsmithred	2. config option to skip the rsync so a saved temp directory can be modified manually, then snapshot can reprocess it regardless of the state of current running system
2011-07-31 16:15:18	fsmithred	that sounds to me like an option that should be hidden for only the elite to use
2011-07-31 16:15:34	nadir	if you ask me:
2011-07-31 16:15:37	nadir	keep it simple.
2011-07-31 16:15:41	nadir	not so much choices.
2011-07-31 16:15:44	fsmithred	yeah
2011-07-31 16:15:53	fsmithred	that would be sticking to Dean's original ideas
2011-07-31 16:15:57	nadir	yup.
2011-07-31 16:16:01	nadir	pretty much.
2011-07-31 16:16:11	nadir	installer installs, snapshot snapshots.
2011-07-31 16:16:17	nadir	thats all they do, no magic.
2011-07-31 16:16:27	nadir	better for troubleshooting.
2011-07-31 16:16:35	nadir	i edited excludes for ever,
2011-07-31 16:17:05	nadir	and finally figured out that somewhere it was set to us /usr/local/lib/refractasnapshot/exclude.
2011-07-31 16:17:07	nadir	duh.
2011-07-31 16:17:31	fsmithred	yeah, before the last version of script, I had the code wrong, and it wasn't using the config file
2011-07-31 16:17:35	fsmithred	so it used all defaults
2011-07-31 16:17:55	fsmithred	was very confusing
2011-07-31 16:18:24	nadir	yes.
2011-07-31 16:18:27	nadir	confusing.
2011-07-31 16:18:29	nadir	for me.
2011-07-31 16:18:36	fsmithred	oh, one thing I could definitely use help with...
2011-07-31 16:18:54	fsmithred	figuring out if the license allows me to distribute parts of isolinux
2011-07-31 16:19:09	nadir	ah.
2011-07-31 16:19:13	nadir	no idea, sorry.
2011-07-31 16:19:39	nadir	when it comes to licenses i talk about stuff i don't understand.
2011-07-31 16:19:58	nadir	i think kelsoo is good with it.
2011-07-31 16:20:08	nadir	which license is it, btw?
2011-07-31 16:20:29	fsmithred	I think I can do it, but need to make some kind of mention of it in package somewhere
2011-07-31 16:21:47	fsmithred	GPL-2+
2011-07-31 16:21:55	nadir	ok.
2011-07-31 16:22:06	nadir	that one kelsoo should know.
2011-07-31 16:22:25	nadir	(i stop listening when he starts about licenses, but  it sounds like he understands it)
2011-07-31 16:23:17	nadir	did you make your post at international yet?
2011-07-31 16:23:22	fsmithred	no
2011-07-31 16:24:58	nadir	ok.
2011-07-31 16:25:10	nadir	i should go there now and then.
2011-07-31 16:25:35	nadir	if you like we can have at references until next week.
2011-07-31 16:25:44	nadir	not that one could do anything useful with it...
2011-07-31 16:26:15	nadir	but it helps with stuff which will come ( mhh...object-tralala)
2011-07-31 16:26:31	nadir	i think, sure.
2011-07-31 16:27:28	fsmithred	maybe
2011-07-31 16:27:39	fsmithred	see if I can get through that chapter again
2011-07-31 16:27:39	nadir	we will see.
2011-07-31 16:27:51	nadir	lets do it more loose
2011-07-31 16:28:08	nadir	i test a lot of new apps, like blosxom, that is fun.
2011-07-31 16:28:12	nadir	perl i do when able to.
2011-07-31 16:28:17	fsmithred	if you write exercises, let me see them
2011-07-31 16:28:21	nadir	not much fun. :-)
2011-07-31 16:28:28	nadir	ok, i will try to put some at git.
2011-07-31 16:28:36	nadir	perl-tmp
2011-07-31 16:28:37	fsmithred	the addpics script was fun
2011-07-31 16:28:41	nadir	yes.
2011-07-31 16:28:45	nadir	very much fun.
2011-07-31 16:28:55	nadir	so: i stand corrected.
2011-07-31 16:29:14	nadir	i can't stand if i feel to dumb for something.
2011-07-31 16:29:17	nadir	very bad at it.
2011-07-31 16:29:18	fsmithred	about the LI post...
2011-07-31 16:29:21	nadir	thats why i complain.
2011-07-31 16:29:27	nadir	i need to shower.
2011-07-31 16:29:31	fsmithred	I did make a text file with known bugs in 6.0.5
2011-07-31 16:29:35	nadir	didn't do it in four days. hungry too.
2011-07-31 16:29:39	fsmithred	ok
2011-07-31 16:29:39	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-07-31 16:29:50	nadir	see us,ok?
2011-07-31 16:29:56	fsmithred	yup
2011-07-31 16:29:57	nadir	or is there something left?
2011-07-31 16:30:09	fsmithred	I'll probably post or email you some time this week
2011-07-31 16:30:15	nadir	good.
2011-07-31 16:30:18	fsmithred	take care
2011-07-31 16:30:22	nadir	see us, bye. :-)

2011-07-31 20:14:44	nadir	well, well, well, that is easy said.
2011-07-31 20:17:09	nadir	and its more the situation in general.
2011-07-31 20:24:33	dbb0	no one can tell you what is "right"
2011-07-31 20:25:02	dbb0	just because someone has more experience doesn't mean he has absolutely true knowledge
2011-07-31 20:25:17	dbb0	that goes for anyone
2011-07-31 20:25:41	nadir	i would probably have sticked to bash, and be done with it.
2011-07-31 20:26:43	dbb0	some people like to be really good at one thing. others like to do a little bit of everything
2011-07-31 20:27:07	nadir	and i still think it is not a bad advice (for people who want to automate some things, and thats it)
2011-07-31 20:27:17	nadir	yeah, i like more one thing.
2011-07-31 20:27:24	dbb0	the problem with programming is that no one language is universally sufficient imo
2011-07-31 20:27:35	nadir	yup, that is the problem.
2011-07-31 20:27:59	dbb0	so you can't expect to learn just bash or just perl and tap into all the power of a computer
2011-07-31 20:28:13	dbb0	regardless of whether a language is turing complete
2011-07-31 20:28:19	nadir	no, but, to put it different.
2011-07-31 20:28:42	nadir	you can learn one real language after the other (Spanish,French, English, Portuges, etc)
2011-07-31 20:28:59	nadir	or you learn English, and your chances are high it will work often.
2011-07-31 20:29:13	nadir	hope this makes sense.
2011-07-31 20:29:25	dbb0	yeah, some are more versatile than others
2011-07-31 20:30:03	nadir	and, guessing, with perl,python, bash, and perhaps ruby, you can get a long way on Linux
2011-07-31 20:30:16	nadir	but bash is more easy.
2011-07-31 20:30:31	dbb0	i would disagree
2011-07-31 20:30:57	nadir	uhum.
2011-07-31 20:31:18	nadir	ok, for me its more easy.
2011-07-31 20:31:28	nadir	i hate that more than one way approach.
2011-07-31 20:31:42	dbb0	i think the best plan is one shell, one interpreted language, and one compiled language (C)
2011-07-31 20:31:53	dbb0	not one shell and 3 interpreted languages
2011-07-31 20:32:03	nadir	ah, got you now
2011-07-31 20:32:19	nadir	i didn't mean those three, i meant any of those four.
2011-07-31 20:32:36	nadir	and, like said,  i mean it for peopl who simply want to do a bit of automation.
2011-07-31 20:32:49	nadir	not for people who want to go down the rabbit hole
2011-07-31 20:33:43	dbb0	that's what shell scripts are for: simple procedural programs
2011-07-31 20:33:55	nadir	exactly.
2011-07-31 20:34:06	dbb0	http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozedurale_Programmierung
2011-07-31 20:34:23	dbb0	i try to use a more functional style with perl
2011-07-31 20:34:50	dbb0	but occasionally some procedural programming is useful or even necessary
2011-07-31 20:35:24	dbb0	i also wanted to tell you something on behalf of myself as well as telemachus
2011-07-31 20:35:32	nadir	yes
2011-07-31 20:36:14	dbb0	whenever one of us makes a suggestion like "don't use <br/> in html" or "try markdown"
2011-07-31 20:36:39	dbb0	we don't mean to sound like we know everything and you don't know anything
2011-07-31 20:37:09	dbb0	i don't consider myself a programming expert by any stretch of the imagination
2011-07-31 20:37:48	dbb0	i really try to criticize constructively because i think that's productive
2011-07-31 20:37:56	nadir	yeah, sure.
2011-07-31 20:38:20	nadir	but i am at the end of a workaround for a workaround. at least when it comes to markdown.
2011-07-31 20:38:44	nadir	i want x, do y to reach x, and then  i can't go for z too.
2011-07-31 20:38:54	dbb0	that's called yak shaving
2011-07-31 20:38:57	nadir	becauce that way i will never ever do x, which is what i wanted to do.
2011-07-31 20:39:14	dbb0	http://ithaca.arpinum.org/2010/01/02/yak-shaving.html
2011-07-31 20:39:22	dbb0	on telemachus' blog
2011-07-31 20:39:27	nadir	yes, i forgot the correct word, exactly that.
2011-07-31 20:39:42	dbb0	it happens to everybody
2011-07-31 20:39:45	nadir	if i now start wiht anything new i will jump out of the window
2011-07-31 20:39:50	nadir	(first floor, btw)
2011-07-31 20:40:04	nadir	thats why i said above: its more a general problem.
2011-07-31 20:40:09	nadir	i hate that.
2011-07-31 20:40:24	dbb0	but it's not like your under a deadline
2011-07-31 20:40:36	nadir	ah, well, i got that ... problem.
2011-07-31 20:40:38	dbb0	you're just doing it for fun, right
2011-07-31 20:40:39	nadir	stress.
2011-07-31 20:40:47	nadir	well: i hope so.
2011-07-31 20:40:59	nadir	i got ca 20 years to live. thats the only deadline.
2011-07-31 20:41:12	dbb0	well if it stresses you out then maybe it's not a good hobby
2011-07-31 20:41:14	nadir	but yeah: for fun
2011-07-31 20:41:23	nadir	nope, i do everything like that.
2011-07-31 20:42:02	dbb0	you mean you take it seriously
2011-07-31 20:42:17	nadir	yup, and too seriously (at least sometimes)
2011-07-31 20:42:26	nadir	but it too is fun.
2011-07-31 20:42:47	dbb0	well just don't take anything i say too seriously
2011-07-31 20:43:00	nadir	well, i do take it seriously.
2011-07-31 20:43:04	nadir	its good advice.
2011-07-31 20:43:19	dbb0	i'm not going to tell you what is right or wrong. there is only my opinion/preference
2011-07-31 20:43:39	nadir	ok, i got that.
2011-07-31 20:43:55	nadir	but don't hesitate.
2011-07-31 20:44:52	nadir	i am not sure if you got that that i am still very young at the PC.
2011-07-31 20:45:03	nadir	i got a lot to learn, so some things i can't follow
2011-07-31 20:45:06	nadir	even if it is good.
2011-07-31 20:45:15	nadir	example: i simply can't learn much of html.
2011-07-31 20:45:25	nadir	i do a bit at a time, but thats it.
2011-07-31 20:45:44	nadir	different: i hammer sites togehter, somehow.
2011-07-31 20:45:58	nadir	well: one site, not sites.
2011-07-31 20:46:27	nadir	i got two css files, and i got no clue why.
2011-07-31 20:46:29	nadir	lol
2011-07-31 20:46:50	dbb0	a lot of sites do that
2011-07-31 20:46:59	nadir	i hate it.
2011-07-31 20:47:11	nadir	cause it makes me hesitate to change things.
2011-07-31 20:47:15	dbb0	i think you can use that to override some settings
2011-07-31 20:47:20	nadir	would be better with more structure.
2011-07-31 20:48:02	nadir	all i wanted was to put my writngs online. did it with OOffice
2011-07-31 20:48:14	nadir	telemachus said: big fuck (when seing the code)
2011-07-31 20:48:21	nadir	thats how i ran into it at all.
2011-07-31 20:48:45	nadir	not that i had the idea: hey, markus, knowing bit of html would be fun, no?
2011-07-31 20:48:48	dbb0	so why didn't you use wordpress, blogger, tumblr, etc.
2011-07-31 20:48:56	nadir	did not know them at that time
2011-07-31 20:50:16	nadir	i really don't know much apps.
2011-07-31 20:50:35	dbb0	i had a blogspot http://debiandan.blogspot.com/
2011-07-31 20:50:40	dbb0	don't really use it anymore
2011-07-31 20:50:57	dbb0	you don't really need to know anything. you just type and click "post"
2011-07-31 20:51:06	nadir	not sure if you got that, i only want to use [py]blosxom or blogs to store commands.
2011-07-31 20:51:13	nadir	say: how to do debootstrap
2011-07-31 20:51:18	nadir	how to set up git.
2011-07-31 20:51:51	nadir	could write all of them in html , but that way i will never do it.
2011-07-31 20:52:00	dbb0	yeah, that's pretty much what i did with blogger
2011-07-31 20:52:32	nadir	i got all of it on hardisk, and read it with cat.
2011-07-31 20:52:43	nadir	putting it online is a bit of comfort... but thats it.
2011-07-31 20:52:48	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-31 20:53:27	nadir	one question, can you tell me again the br-tag story.
2011-07-31 20:53:32	nadir	i am so confused now,
2011-07-31 20:53:45	nadir	is it <br> <br/> <br /> and where?
2011-07-31 20:53:51	nadir	besides that its shit in general
2011-07-31 20:55:44	dbb0	html => '<br>' ; xhtml => '<br />'
2011-07-31 20:55:57	dbb0	<br/> is also fine in xhtml
2011-07-31 20:56:06	nadir	ok, so i for one , html, will remove the / altogether.
2011-07-31 20:56:20	dbb0	it still works in html
2011-07-31 20:56:34	dbb0	it's just considered ambiguous by the w3
2011-07-31 20:57:38	nadir	ok.
2011-07-31 20:58:00	nadir	i try to avoid errors. does not always work, but i would not want to use it wrong per se.
2011-07-31 20:58:06	nadir	once the subject was there .
2011-07-31 20:58:36	dbb0	just play around with "direct input" on the validator
2011-07-31 20:59:08	nadir	ah, yeah, good point.
2011-07-31 21:02:09	nadir	did you check the python reference for your problem (which i don't understand)
2011-07-31 21:03:01	dbb0	yeah
2011-07-31 21:03:11	nadir	ah, i thought so.
2011-07-31 21:03:19	nadir	it often help, but not always.
2011-07-31 21:05:36	dbb0	python has pretty terrible documentation compared to perl
2011-07-31 21:06:19	nadir	puh.
2011-07-31 21:06:29	nadir	i just wanted to say the other way around. lol
2011-07-31 21:12:35	dbb0	most of the time perldoc tells me exactly what i want to know in a couple lines, then gives another 2 pages in case i want to know more
2011-07-31 21:13:17	nadir	perlintro i like a lot.
2011-07-31 21:13:30	nadir	some of perldoc -f foo is above me
2011-07-31 21:13:49	nadir	well: so are the manpages, so its not unusual
2011-07-31 21:14:18	nadir	what was your player with the un-rememberable name again?
2011-07-31 21:17:12	nadir	but the books i know, about perl, are a bit annoying in trying to be cool.
2011-07-31 21:55:45	nadir	like this: To change John's eyes to "red" after a night on the town
2011-07-31 22:13:51	dbb0	quodlibet or ncmpcpp
2011-07-31 22:15:28	nadir	ah, exaclty. quodlibet.
2011-07-31 22:15:34	nadir	exactly
2011-07-31 22:33:51	dbb0	ex falso sequitur quodlibet

2011-08-02 17:28:29	@telemachus	(What I'm working on now...)
2011-08-02 17:28:50	dbb0	it was just a cut at him because i think he's a prick
2011-08-02 17:29:17	@telemachus	oh, ok
2011-08-02 17:29:19	nadir	ah, ok. my fault then. i do too much at once... so it was more of a tiop for me.
2011-08-02 17:29:30	@telemachus	nadir: You may be right actually
2011-08-02 17:29:35	@telemachus	Maybe I should switch
2011-08-02 17:29:41	@telemachus	but I really want to improve at js
2011-08-02 17:29:48	@telemachus	we'll see
2011-08-02 17:30:35	nadir	the link/font foo worked, btw.
2011-08-02 17:30:46	@telemachus	cool
2011-08-02 17:30:47	@telemachus	glad
2011-08-02 17:31:42	nadir	i got to ask the both of you something. about ..mhh... markdown.
2011-08-02 17:31:56	nadir	i re-installed zim, a strange editor (said to be wiki like)
2011-08-02 17:32:11	nadir	so i made some notes, to test if i can easily insert clickable links to http
2011-08-02 17:32:14	nadir	all good.
2011-08-02 17:32:28	@telemachus	ok
2011-08-02 17:32:28	nadir	then i found a menu-item: print to web-browser. did that.
2011-08-02 17:32:36	nadir	looked at the source-code of the page.
2011-08-02 17:32:52	nadir	and, voila, it looked like html, and not fucked up, but, as far i can tell, ok
2011-08-02 17:33:00	@telemachus	ok
2011-08-02 17:33:18	dbb0	like convert to html in vim?
2011-08-02 17:33:18	nadir	so, my question, might it be that zim uses some tool like, say, markdown, to transform it?
2011-08-02 17:33:28	nadir	dbb0 i don't know that.
2011-08-02 17:33:43	dbb0	my guess is the intermediate format of markdown would be useless
2011-08-02 17:34:02	dbb0	it's probaby just about getting the colors right
2011-08-02 17:34:24	nadir	what means intermediate here ?
2011-08-02 17:35:10	@telemachus	I don't know how Zim works
2011-08-02 17:35:18	@telemachus	let me try to look up its homepage
2011-08-02 17:35:22	dbb0	nadir: buffer -> md -> html
2011-08-02 17:35:30	nadir	yup, i could do it, but miss too much of the basic terms
2011-08-02 17:35:36	nadir	dbb0, ok.
2011-08-02 17:35:39	nadir	ah, ok, got it.
2011-08-02 17:36:00	dbb0	markdown is for humans to write. it wouldn't be useful to a program like that
2011-08-02 17:36:16	@telemachus	Yeah, this is Markdown it uses. That's common in wikis, so it makes sense: http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Help/Wiki_Syntax.html
2011-08-02 17:36:27	nadir	aha, thanks.
2011-08-02 17:36:46	nadir	so all i do, if i would use zim, is using a gui-tool to do what could also be done manually.
2011-08-02 17:37:32	@telemachus	probably
2011-08-02 17:37:33	@telemachus	yes
2011-08-02 17:37:44	@telemachus	but I'm not sure 100% what zim does
2011-08-02 17:38:01	nadir	i guess you remember the resulting html of OpenOffice, so i really was astonished the result of zim was "ok".
2011-08-02 17:38:33	nadir	ok -> very clear and readable. not sure if fully correct.
2011-08-02 17:38:38	 *	telemachus nods
2011-08-02 17:38:49	dbb0	telemachus: it says its docuwiki syntax (e.g. links are different)
2011-08-02 17:39:33	@telemachus	dbb0: Yeah, fair enough. It's a variant I guess. I didn't look so closely at links. Thanks.
2011-08-02 17:39:39	dbb0	nadir: you're talking about editing a file and then viewing it in a browser with the same syntax highlighting?
2011-08-02 17:39:52	nadir	mhh... bit of a shame, but:
2011-08-02 17:40:04	nadir	i am looking for a workaround in case i don't find the right syntax.
2011-08-02 17:40:25	nadir	i write it the way i want it to be shown, wysiwyg
2011-08-02 17:40:32	dbb0	show me a screenshot of what you're talking about
2011-08-02 17:40:42	nadir	i open it in the browser, and look at the code
2011-08-02 17:40:53	nadir	ok, give me a couple, then i will show you.
2011-08-02 17:41:38	nadir	(i first need to install zim on this machine...)
2011-08-02 17:43:39	dbb0	it's no big deal
2011-08-02 17:47:41	nadir	well, well , well... here it gets opened in geany if i click on "print to browser". damn.
2011-08-02 17:52:48	nadir	http://secretpicdump.com/de/view/12373_17992_zimwebsource.png/
2011-08-02 17:53:13	nadir	top right is zim, i make my editing.
2011-08-02 17:53:26	nadir	open it in browser, the app to the left.
2011-08-02 17:53:38	nadir	view the source code, bottom right.
2011-08-02 17:56:14	dbb0	ok
2011-08-02 17:57:21	dbb0	markdown and docuwiki are types of markup
2011-08-02 17:57:59	dbb0	so is wikitext (used by mediawiki sites)
2011-08-02 17:58:11	dbb0	they're all really similar
2011-08-02 17:58:32	@telemachus	sorry guys, I'm off to deal with dinner
2011-08-02 17:58:37	@telemachus	see you both soon
2011-08-02 17:58:37	nadir	yup.
2011-08-02 17:58:38	dbb0	later t
2011-08-02 18:00:23	nadir	but the general idea is to write like usual (like text), add the markdown (or other syntax),
2011-08-02 18:00:29	nadir	convert to html,  and use that?
2011-08-02 18:02:51	dbb0	no, unless vim has a "raw" or "source" mode
2011-08-02 18:04:15	dbb0	like where you can type [http://foo external link name] and get a hyperlink in the resulting html
2011-08-02 18:04:28	dbb0	or you do just click "insert link" or something
2011-08-02 18:05:40	dbb0	*do you
2011-08-02 18:06:13	nadir	i am not sure we understand each other.
2011-08-02 18:06:22	nadir	if you speak of zim, i spoke of markdown in general
2011-08-02 18:06:46	nadir	not about an editor.
2011-08-02 18:07:14	dbb0	ok
2011-08-02 18:07:32	dbb0	the idea is to use the markup language itself to produce html
2011-08-02 18:07:47	dbb0	you don't convert your text to markdown
2011-08-02 18:07:52	dbb0	you write markdown
2011-08-02 18:09:59	dbb0	https://gist.github.com/1121356
2011-08-02 18:10:15	dbb0	save that as file.md and run: markdown file.md
2011-08-02 18:13:00	nadir	might be i got it.
2011-08-02 18:52:22	nadir	bye

2011-08-04 13:43:38	fsmithred	hi
2011-08-04 13:43:43	nadir	just tested the addpics resizer again.
2011-08-04 13:43:46	nadir	does a good job
2011-08-04 13:43:50	fsmithred	cool
2011-08-04 13:43:52	nadir	yup
2011-08-04 13:43:55	fsmithred	which one are you using?
2011-08-04 13:44:01	nadir	holy shit. not sure.
2011-08-04 13:44:13	fsmithred	the last one uses, um
2011-08-04 13:44:21	fsmithred	File::Basename
2011-08-04 13:44:47	nadir	give me a sec to find the link
2011-08-04 13:44:50	fsmithred	well, that's the last one that I worked on

2011-08-04 13:46:51	nadir	it does not use File::Basename, as far i see.
2011-08-04 13:47:30	nadir	if you want to give me a new nick, have a look here:
2011-08-04 13:47:33	fsmithred	right
2011-08-04 13:47:35	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/images/gallery/pictures/c%29%20stuff/hacking_nasa.jpg
2011-08-04 13:47:38	fsmithred	that one looks familiar
2011-08-04 13:48:14	nadir	yeah, its probably copied and pasted from the forum.
2011-08-04 13:48:19	fsmithred	is that your usb modem?
2011-08-04 13:48:22	nadir	yup
2011-08-04 13:48:33	fsmithred	I like it
2011-08-04 13:48:52	nadir	I like it a lot, but it did not work.
2011-08-04 13:48:52	fsmithred	looks like a UHF tv antenna that an engineer gave to my father when I was a kid
2011-08-04 13:49:11	fsmithred	worked better than the store-bought model
2011-08-04 13:49:35	nadir	it was fun building it, a pity it does not do any good.
2011-08-04 13:49:39	nadir	(as far i can see)
2011-08-04 13:50:28	fsmithred	paste and go???
2011-08-04 13:50:32	fsmithred	whoa
2011-08-04 13:50:37	fsmithred	just noticed that
2011-08-04 13:50:44	fsmithred	in ff 5
2011-08-04 13:50:54	nadir	paste and go?
2011-08-04 13:51:00	fsmithred	yup
2011-08-04 13:51:10	fsmithred	paste the url into the address bar and go there
2011-08-04 13:51:12	fsmithred	all in one
2011-08-04 13:54:44	fsmithred	addpics is your own version
2011-08-04 13:54:55	fsmithred	not the same as any that I've got posted
2011-08-04 13:54:58	fsmithred	but close
2011-08-04 13:55:33	nadir	well: it does the job, so i am fine with it.
2011-08-04 13:55:41	fsmithred	mine remove empty thumbnail folders
2011-08-04 13:55:57	nadir	ah, i removed it for some (unknown ) reason
2011-08-04 13:56:03	nadir	or i did never add it, who knows
2011-08-04 13:56:32	nadir	did you try more with blosxom?
2011-08-04 13:56:37	nadir	or pyblosxom?
2011-08-04 13:56:40	fsmithred	nope
2011-08-04 13:56:44	fsmithred	been working on snapshot
2011-08-04 13:56:50	nadir	but you did some .... you said it already.
2011-08-04 13:56:51	fsmithred	put up a gui version
2011-08-04 13:56:55	nadir	i have seen the post
2011-08-04 13:57:17	fsmithred	it work, but I'm not so happy with it
2011-08-04 13:57:28	nadir	why?
2011-08-04 13:57:44	fsmithred	want to be able to go back and forth between the disk space report and the options
2011-08-04 13:57:49	fsmithred	but it's limited
2011-08-04 13:58:09	fsmithred	having trouble bouncing between two functions multiple times
2011-08-04 13:58:38	fsmithred	I think you need to see the report, so you know if you need to change the work dir and snapshot dir
2011-08-04 13:58:55	fsmithred	and then you need to see the report again after you change them
2011-08-04 13:59:09	fsmithred	and be able to do that again
2011-08-04 13:59:14	fsmithred	as many times as you'd like
2011-08-04 13:59:20	nadir	umf
2011-08-04 13:59:30	fsmithred	but I can't do it
2011-08-04 14:00:24	fsmithred	can only repeat the options window once, then it goes right to making the snapshot
2011-08-04 14:00:52	fsmithred	added a couple lines to the piece that looks at free space
2011-08-04 14:01:00	fsmithred	so it looks at /mnt and /media, too
2011-08-04 14:01:15	fsmithred	in case you need to plug in an external hard drive
2011-08-04 14:01:23	fsmithred	and do the work on that
2011-08-04 14:02:20	fsmithred	also would like to be able to run it without looking at the options window at all
2011-08-04 14:02:32	fsmithred	actaully, I think it does work that way
2011-08-04 14:02:39	fsmithred	can't remember
2011-08-04 14:02:51	fsmithred	I've had six versions since yesterday
2011-08-04 14:02:59	fsmithred	most didn't work
2011-08-04 14:03:03	nadir	holy jesus
2011-08-04 14:03:27	fsmithred	and I fought with it most of the day
2011-08-04 14:03:38	fsmithred	some syntax errors preventing it from running
2011-08-04 14:03:51	fsmithred	had trouble finding them
2011-08-04 14:04:05	fsmithred	one was complaining about a missing "
2011-08-04 14:04:23	fsmithred	but accoring to syntax highlighting, everything was good
2011-08-04 14:05:50	nadir	so the two functions are called: report_space() and set_options() ; right?
2011-08-04 14:05:54	fsmithred	you tried ff 5 yet?
2011-08-04 14:05:57	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-04 14:06:04	fsmithred	and they're fucking looong
2011-08-04 14:06:07	nadir	it runs here but i can't say i tried much
2011-08-04 14:06:37	nadir	and you can't ask in report_space() "run set_options again?" and vice versa?
2011-08-04 14:07:00	fsmithred	I think it only works one way
2011-08-04 14:07:03	fsmithred	lemme look at it
2011-08-04 14:07:08	nadir	second
2011-08-04 14:07:27	nadir	if i recall correct bash has got problems to use a function which comes later (so to speak).
2011-08-04 14:07:40	nadir	perhaps clone the one function, and move it around?
2011-08-04 14:07:50	nadir	hope this makes sense... i am rather tired.
2011-08-04 14:08:09	fsmithred	yeah, one has to come first
2011-08-04 14:08:18	fsmithred	I tried adding a third function to call both of them
2011-08-04 14:08:26	fsmithred	but that one only runs part way through
2011-08-04 14:08:34	fsmithred	doesn't get into either function
2011-08-04 14:08:39	fsmithred	and doesn't give any error message
2011-08-04 14:09:07	nadir	ah.
2011-08-04 14:09:09	nadir	fuck.
2011-08-04 14:09:53	fsmithred	report_space can call back set_options, but only once
2011-08-04 14:09:59	fsmithred	not sure why
2011-08-04 14:10:58	fsmithred	oh, I guess after it finishes that function, it picks up where it left off
2011-08-04 14:11:12	fsmithred	and next thing is to make the snapshot
2011-08-04 14:12:17	fsmithred	oh, I've got check_space and report_space in separate functions
2011-08-04 14:12:31	fsmithred	I did that just to make them smaller, so I could find the error
2011-08-04 14:12:44	fsmithred	before, they were all in one function
2011-08-04 14:14:33	nadir	i will try to look into it tomorrow, but can't give a promise
2011-08-04 14:14:41	fsmithred	ok, no hurry
2011-08-04 14:14:52	nadir	i switch a lot between all kind of things right now.
2011-08-04 14:15:16	nadir	very unconcentrated (the word does not seem to exist, but i think it gives the idea)
2011-08-04 14:15:29	fsmithred	yup
2011-08-04 14:15:52	fsmithred	unfocused
2011-08-04 14:15:57	nadir	first of all i can download it and run it in Vbox.
2011-08-04 14:16:02	nadir	yup, unfocsed.
2011-08-04 14:16:12	fsmithred	I'm actually updating it now
2011-08-04 14:16:20	nadir	I do one thing one day, am very engaged and excited, and the next day something very different.
2011-08-04 14:16:20	fsmithred	just removed a few lines that aren't needed
2011-08-04 14:16:51	nadir	you will be here saturday or sunday? if yes i hope i can, at least, give a report on running it.
2011-08-04 14:17:09	fsmithred	yeah, I plan to be here
2011-08-04 14:17:26	nadir	ok. will try. else i can do it while you are here.
2011-08-04 14:17:35	fsmithred	thanks
2011-08-04 14:17:50	nadir	but it would be better to be prepared. a bit too difficult to do it on the fly.
2011-08-04 14:17:55	fsmithred	I'd especially like you to try it with different work_dir and/or snapshot_dir
2011-08-04 14:18:02	nadir	ok.
2011-08-04 14:18:15	nadir	that would be set_options() ?
2011-08-04 14:18:22	fsmithred	y
2011-08-04 14:18:37	nadir	ok. i am tired like a  bulldog. don't  be mad if i mix it all up.
2011-08-04 14:18:47	fsmithred	np
2011-08-04 14:18:54	fsmithred	play with it when you're awake
2011-08-04 14:19:04	nadir	just wanted to go to bed, then my neighbour came, made some shots of me,
2011-08-04 14:19:11	nadir	then he started with photoshop...
2011-08-04 14:19:21	fsmithred	geez
2011-08-04 14:19:24	nadir	i was thankful, but sat there like a dead man.
2011-08-04 14:19:41	fsmithred	he was showing you how to use photoshop?
2011-08-04 14:19:43	nadir	and damn,  he is really good with it.
2011-08-04 14:19:50	nadir	he edited the photos.
2011-08-04 14:19:55	nadir	he did not explain much.
2011-08-04 14:20:13	nadir	looked pretty similar to gimp in my eyes.
2011-08-04 14:20:18	nadir	not that i would know much of it.
2011-08-04 14:20:36	fsmithred	well, lots of the same things, but the arrangement of stuff in the menus is totally different
2011-08-04 14:20:43	nadir	ah.
2011-08-04 14:20:58	fsmithred	which is main reason why people who've used photoshop hate gimp
2011-08-04 14:21:22	nadir	i can understand that. He is not a pro, but did it really fast.
2011-08-04 14:21:33	nadir	so: if oyu have to re-learn all that, sure not much fun.
2011-08-04 14:21:41	fsmithred	yup
2011-08-04 14:22:13	nadir	he does a lot of politic stuff (media-like), he is from Persia
2011-08-04 14:22:20	nadir	for women and all.
2011-08-04 14:23:02	nadir	even if one is not interested in politics, what he does is interesting.
2011-08-04 14:23:11	nadir	and now comes the funny part:
2011-08-04 14:23:18	nadir	he can't install applications.
2011-08-04 14:23:24	nadir	none. nada. njet
2011-08-04 14:23:26	nadir	nix
2011-08-04 14:23:38	fsmithred	on windows?
2011-08-04 14:23:41	nadir	yup
2011-08-04 14:24:04	nadir	and i am not kidding.
2011-08-04 14:24:11	nadir	i had to do it more than once for him
2011-08-04 14:24:26	fsmithred	wow
2011-08-04 14:24:36	nadir	i know a lot of such people.
2011-08-04 14:24:45	nadir	Over here everyone knows someone who knows someone.
2011-08-04 14:24:59	nadir	they install for them, with a big important face.
2011-08-04 14:25:04	fsmithred	lol
2011-08-04 14:25:06	nadir	So a lot of people did never do it.
2011-08-04 14:25:32	nadir	they know the apps really good (be it Office, or here photoshop or what)
2011-08-04 14:25:45	nadir	If firefox asks: shall i install an update of that plugin?
2011-08-04 14:25:47	nadir	they are lost
2011-08-04 14:27:03	nadir	and the ones i know, all stock germans (as law-loving as can be)
2011-08-04 14:27:17	nadir	run crackware versions of M$lost
2011-08-04 14:27:20	nadir	M$lot
2011-08-04 14:27:25	nadir	that is strange too.
2011-08-04 14:27:28	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-04 14:27:45	nadir	i mean, come'on. Its 100
2011-08-04 14:27:52	nadir	and that is for 7 or more years.
2011-08-04 14:30:31	nadir	i should better go sleeping.
2011-08-04 14:31:41	nadir	keep me informed (remind me) of snapshot.
2011-08-04 14:31:41	nadir	see us satur/sunday, ok?
2011-08-04 14:31:41	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-04 14:31:41	fsmithred	yup
2011-08-04 14:31:41	fsmithred	have good dreams
2011-08-04 14:31:41	nadir	i usually am here, as long my PC is on, so in case..
2011-08-04 14:31:45	nadir	thanks, bye.
2011-08-04 14:31:46	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-04 14:31:47	fsmithred	bye

2011-08-04 22:24:03	@antinoos	<dbb0/#study-group/2011-08-03> have you had any problems with perltidy and closing side comments?
2011-08-04 22:24:08	@telemachus	all
2011-08-04 22:24:10	@telemachus	even
2011-08-04 22:24:16	nadir	hi
2011-08-04 22:24:33	@telemachus	hey, nadir
2011-08-04 22:24:51	nadir	i just awoke, did not no anyone was here.
2011-08-04 22:25:03	@telemachus	!memo dbb0 I've never used perltidy. I do it manually, for the most part, but I started adding some Vim things for cleaning up whitespace errors.
2011-08-04 22:25:03	@antinoos	Added memo for dbb0
2011-08-04 22:25:04	nadir	thanks for the explanations bout sql
2011-08-04 22:25:08	@telemachus	np
2011-08-04 22:25:15	@telemachus	Did it make sense?
2011-08-04 22:25:19	nadir	bit of brainfarting, at least for me.
2011-08-04 22:25:24	nadir	most of it.
2011-08-04 22:25:35	nadir	if i think too long about it i get confused, but i got the main idea
2011-08-04 22:25:37	nadir	i hope
2011-08-04 22:25:59	@telemachus	yup
2011-08-04 22:26:12	nadir	must be 4 or 5 users and passwords altogether. That is too much for an old dog
2011-08-04 22:26:25	@telemachus	yeah, for security reasons that's true
2011-08-04 22:26:43	nadir	i first picked only one pw, to get it done at all.
2011-08-04 22:26:46	@telemachus	you want a root user with all perms and a separate low-power user for each app
2011-08-04 22:26:53	 *	telemachus nods
2011-08-04 22:26:56	@telemachus	many people do that
2011-08-04 22:27:02	@telemachus	it's bad in the long run
2011-08-04 22:27:10	@telemachus	opens you up to big danger
2011-08-04 22:27:29	nadir	now i made pwgen, and that makes things more clear
2011-08-04 22:27:47	@telemachus	yeah, I use pwsafe for that
2011-08-04 22:27:48	nadir	so, it would be reasonable to use user "wordpress" for the app wordpress?
2011-08-04 22:27:48	nadir	serendipity for the app serendipity...
2011-08-04 22:27:48	nadir	was that a No?
2011-08-04 22:29:06	@telemachus	better not to
2011-08-04 22:29:12	@telemachus	too obvious
2011-08-04 22:29:20	nadir	ok, got it.
2011-08-04 22:29:23	@telemachus	maybe mr_wordpress
2011-08-04 22:29:30	@telemachus	and mrs_serendipity
2011-08-04 22:29:31	@telemachus	lol
2011-08-04 22:29:31	nadir	mr_big-balls
2011-08-04 22:29:48	nadir	i am a bit confused by all my names.... thats why i asked.
2011-08-04 22:30:01	@telemachus	I know, I get that
2011-08-04 22:30:05	nadir	but the sql-app-user does _not need to be a user at the system, right?
2011-08-04 22:30:14	@telemachus	But if the name is too obvious to you, it's too obvious to attackers
2011-08-04 22:30:16	@telemachus	right
2011-08-04 22:30:20	nadir	(if i loose my pw-txt, i am done with my life)
2011-08-04 22:30:22	@telemachus	the mysql user is separate
2011-08-04 22:30:31	nadir	uhum
2011-08-04 22:30:42	nadir	so its back to the Beckett (anti-)heros
2011-08-04 22:30:58	@telemachus	mhmm
2011-08-04 22:31:03	@telemachus	strong silent guys?
2011-08-04 22:31:20	nadir	without yours and the other fellows help  i would not have understood it.
2011-08-04 22:32:12	nadir	not sure if that is what the stock human calls strong:
2011-08-04 22:32:16	nadir	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Naqshineh-Bajestani_2.jpg
2011-08-04 22:32:21	@telemachus	it's hard stuff at first
2011-08-04 22:32:26	nadir	(but yup, i do)
2011-08-04 22:32:32	nadir	mysql?
2011-08-04 22:32:37	@telemachus	yeah
2011-08-04 22:33:07	@telemachus	ok, sorry - I have to log out - nearly no power on this damn thing
2011-08-04 22:33:16	@telemachus	will see you guys over the weekend...
2011-08-04 22:33:24	nadir	yup
2011-08-04 22:33:30	@telemachus	check out dbb0  on github - he's making a static site compiler in Perl
2011-08-04 22:33:32	nadir	and yup to mysql being hard.
2011-08-04 22:33:35	@telemachus	later

2011-08-04 23:01:50	nadir	i am in the middle of this and that and what not.
2011-08-04 23:01:55	dbb0	?
2011-08-04 23:01:57	nadir	but i will sure have a look or try it.
2011-08-04 23:02:09	dbb0	other projects you mean
2011-08-04 23:02:16	nadir	( translation to proper language -> i am busy :-)
2011-08-04 23:02:19	nadir	yup
2011-08-04 23:02:31	nadir	thought it seems to fit pretty well inside of all that.
2011-08-04 23:02:37	nadir	though, not thought
2011-08-04 23:02:53	dbb0	me too. chemistry final tomorrow morning
2011-08-04 23:03:17	nadir	ups. good luck then
2011-08-04 23:03:35	dbb0	thanks
2011-08-04 23:04:22	nadir	but you are a good student, i assume ? (from the way i know you it seems so)
2011-08-04 23:06:28	nadir	the main purpose of my web-site is to store info for me. hence something like a site-generator is what i am looking for.
2011-08-04 23:07:21	dbb0	i'm all right with science/math
2011-08-04 23:08:52	dbb0	right now if you clone plexus.pl and run it with out editing anything it will spit out a header
2011-08-04 23:09:08	dbb0	i havent had time to work on it much this week
2011-08-04 23:10:04	nadir	ah, ok. not sure when i will look into it.
2011-08-04 23:10:14	dbb0	have you looked at jekyll
2011-08-04 23:10:14	nadir	these days (might be two days or two weeks
2011-08-04 23:10:18	nadir	nope
2011-08-04 23:10:37	nadir	ruby?
2011-08-04 23:10:38	dbb0	i think t said it was pretty easy/straightforward to set up
2011-08-04 23:10:57	dbb0	yeah but i don't think you have to use any ruby in your templates
2011-08-04 23:11:01	nadir	i have thought a lot about what you told me (markdown)
2011-08-04 23:11:17	nadir	and besides that i looked into gui apps (drupal and such)
2011-08-04 23:11:39	dbb0	my school
2011-08-04 23:11:45	dbb0	's math dept uses drupal
2011-08-04 23:11:48	nadir	i really don't need much: headlines, paragraphs, line-break
2011-08-04 23:12:00	nadir	ah, so you know it? if yes: what do you say? i say: not bad
2011-08-04 23:12:36	dbb0	i've never used it myself
2011-08-04 23:13:06	dbb0	but it's php
2011-08-04 23:14:55	nadir	as far i see most seem to say that gui-apps are intuitive. For me that usually is not the case.
2011-08-04 23:15:15	nadir	wordpress and so, gave me some trouble. drupal seemed more clear.
2011-08-04 23:16:26	nadir	iirc it has tabs at the top, so you know where you are (admin, editing, like that)
2011-08-04 23:16:34	nadir	while wordpress, again iirc, had a side panel
2011-08-04 23:18:32	dbb0	yeahm i think wordpress is meant for people who just want to type some paragraphs and not worry about configuration
2011-08-04 23:23:02	dbb0	did you put an ad for web.de in your sig on GH?
2011-08-04 23:23:21	nadir	what is GH?
2011-08-04 23:23:37	nadir	ah, github. i don't think i put any adds there.
2011-08-04 23:24:15	nadir	but its one of my email providers, perhaps thats why its there.
2011-08-04 23:33:34	nadir	i am trying to switch email-providers, but its a big mess.

2011-08-05 23:07:21	dbb0	weird, the memo didnt print
2011-08-05 23:07:57	nadir	it did print in the other channel, thanks for the info
2011-08-05 23:08:15	nadir	why it did print in the other channel is beyond me.
2011-08-05 23:08:36	nadir	but you might want to tell telemachus, so he can check if something is borked.
2011-08-05 23:08:50	dbb0	what other channel
2011-08-05 23:09:04	nadir	freenode #friends-of-freedom
2011-08-05 23:09:14	nadir	telemachus did install antinoos there too.
2011-08-05 23:09:18	nadir	but he is not there.
2011-08-05 23:09:46	nadir	i made it to get organized the new forum, back in february.

2011-08-05 23:11:16	dbb0	weird
2011-08-05 23:12:30	nadir	how was chemistry? assuming the answer is fine...
2011-08-05 23:12:37	dbb0	fine
2011-08-05 23:12:44	nadir	lol
2011-08-05 23:13:38	nadir	ok, please give me a mini-how-to-use-plexus, if you got the  time.
2011-08-05 23:16:11	dbb0	edit config
2011-08-05 23:16:18	dbb0	./plexus.pl
2011-08-05 23:17:09	dbb0	head.css is for in-line css, it's optional
2011-08-05 23:17:40	dbb0	eg: <head><style type="text/css"> head.css contents here
2011-08-05 23:18:02	dbb0	you can also put a list of external stylesheets in config, which is what i do
2011-08-05 23:18:31	dbb0	global config file ~/.plexusrc is read first, and ./config will be added to it
2011-08-05 23:18:44	dbb0	head.js is analogous to head.css
2011-08-05 23:19:13	dbb0	if you have markdown files, they will be 'compiled' and put in the right place
2011-08-05 23:19:31	dbb0	if you have .html files, they are copied directly with no editing
2011-08-05 23:20:07	dbb0	the body is assembled in the order: nav.* body.* footer.*
2011-08-05 23:20:35	nadir	it complains bout Config/File.pm not being in @INC
2011-08-05 23:20:44	dbb0	but i believe <nav> and <footer> are only valid in html5, so if you change the doctype they are useless
2011-08-05 23:20:55	dbb0	look at the comment on the use; lines
2011-08-05 23:21:08	dbb0	tells the package names
2011-08-05 23:21:11	dbb0	for debian
2011-08-05 23:21:18	nadir	ah
2011-08-05 23:25:12	dbb0	gave me a good idea- to put dependencies in the readme
2011-08-05 23:26:43	nadir	well: i am much of a noob. looking/reading first of all could have avoided that...
2011-08-05 23:26:59	nadir	and i do three things at once right now
2011-08-05 23:32:28	dbb0	did you just wake up awhile ago
2011-08-05 23:32:43	nadir	yup. half an hour or so
2011-08-05 23:33:17	nadir	but often i am still awake at that time...
2011-08-05 23:34:41	nadir	you use perlbrew?
2011-08-05 23:37:13	dbb0	yeah
2011-08-05 23:38:54	dbb0	it's off most of the time though.
2011-08-05 23:39:50	nadir	how can i turn it off?
2011-08-05 23:39:56	dbb0	perlbrew off
2011-08-05 23:40:01	nadir	thanks
2011-08-05 23:40:37	nadir	in the config it says output_dir = ~/projects/plexus
2011-08-05 23:40:52	dbb0	yeah
2011-08-05 23:40:58	nadir	with the tilde it can't chdir(), if i replace the tilde by full-path it works
2011-08-05 23:41:35	dbb0	the script substitutes the tilde with $ENV{HOME}
2011-08-05 23:41:44	dbb0	it's supposed to anyway
2011-08-05 23:42:04	dbb0	line 118
2011-08-05 23:44:17	dbb0	maybe there's some extra whitespace
2011-08-05 23:45:07	nadir	stupid me, i forgot to git pull first of all... oh my.
2011-08-05 23:45:33	nadir	ok, i am closer now. thanks, will try during the week. If questions i will ask
2011-08-05 23:45:50	dbb0	cool
2011-08-05 23:45:56	nadir	yup. very cool.
2011-08-05 23:49:40	dbb0	ah, the value isn't saved after the substitution
2011-08-05 23:51:40	dbb0	cause im substituting $ch->{'working_dir'} but $wd is set to the old val
2011-08-05 23:52:11	nadir	aha.
2011-08-05 23:52:25	nadir	i found that line with a short search, but could not solve it.
2011-08-05 23:52:56	dbb0	i just commited the change. it should work now
2011-08-05 23:57:46	nadir	that part i really love about git, you change, i pull , and voila.
2011-08-05 23:57:57	nadir	that is cool. But the brainfuck which comes with it is not so cool
2011-08-06 00:21:34	dbb0	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8
2011-08-06 00:21:43	dbb0	funny/informative vid
2011-08-06 00:22:03	nadir	ah, ok. thanks. i am not much a fan of Mr. Torwalds...
2011-08-06 00:22:27	nadir	ah, about git. missed that.
2011-08-06 00:23:08	dbb0	it's a pain just to learn the vocabulary 
2011-08-06 00:31:10	dbb0	% git <TAB>
2011-08-06 00:31:13	dbb0	zsh: do you wish to see all 126 possibilities (136 lines
2011-08-06 00:31:48	nadir	well...
2011-08-06 00:32:00	nadir	i do push, pull, rm, stash, and i guess thats it.
2011-08-06 00:32:23	nadir	i am trying sparkleshare, i don't think its bad.
2011-08-06 00:32:32	nadir	assumin all one wants is to keep it in sync.
2011-08-06 00:32:49	nadir	but it uses quite some Ram
2011-08-06 00:47:32	dbb0	looks like a puffier version of an ftp client
2011-08-06 00:48:05	nadir	!tr en de puffier
2011-08-06 00:48:06	@antinoos	puffier
2011-08-06 00:48:12	nadir	!tr en de puffy
2011-08-06 00:48:13	@antinoos	aufgedunsen
2011-08-06 00:48:49	nadir	if i am not wrong it automatically pulls when started.
2011-08-06 00:49:01	nadir	i don't think ftp-clients do that (but i barely know them)
2011-08-06 00:54:30	dbb0	it was a joke
2011-08-06 00:54:59	nadir	ha. thats not the first time the last days i have seen jokes being misunderstood.
2011-08-06 00:55:24	nadir	I hate Linus. no joke
2011-08-06 00:56:07	nadir	or different: i hate office-kind-of-humor
2011-08-06 00:57:18	nadir	but the jokes aside, the video seems to be revealing.

2011-08-06 10:51:44	@telemachus	what kind?
2011-08-06 10:51:51	nadir	very cheap. 5.
2011-08-06 10:51:54	nadir	only to test it.
2011-08-06 10:51:57	nadir	ekiga.
2011-08-06 10:52:06	nadir	if its fun i might buy a better one.
2011-08-06 10:52:20	@telemachus	for like skyping? is that what ekiga is?

2011-08-06 10:52:51	nadir	yes, its similar to skype. kelsoo has some plans.
2011-08-06 10:53:26	nadir	its good for me to understand a bit more of pc-stuff (microphone, in this case)

2011-08-06 10:57:34	nadir	not sure. might also be a waste of time... but perhaps cool.
2011-08-06 10:58:19	@telemachus	heh
2011-08-06 10:58:45	@telemachus	My father is very into video chatting - tried to get me into it, but I don't even like phone
2011-08-06 10:58:48	@telemachus	much less video

2011-08-06 11:01:21	@telemachus	right

2011-08-06 11:03:41	@telemachus	which is confusing
2011-08-06 11:03:47	@telemachus	since I know people have edited them
2011-08-06 11:03:53	@telemachus	weird
2011-08-06 11:03:56	nadir	yup.
2011-08-06 11:04:03	@telemachus	maybe ask that in a general question to change the preference?
2011-08-06 11:04:07	@telemachus	In another thread that is
2011-08-06 11:04:11	nadir	to hell with them
2011-08-06 11:04:17	nadir	they can do what they want.
2011-08-06 11:04:17	@telemachus	you mad at them again?
2011-08-06 11:04:25	nadir	still, not again.

2011-08-06 11:05:09	@telemachus	ah
2011-08-06 11:05:09	nadir	there was a discussion about making the mods be mods for one year.
2011-08-06 11:05:15	@telemachus	I thought it was better, sorry
2011-08-06 11:05:21	nadir	i said: than the community statement needs to be changed.
2011-08-06 11:05:34	nadir	mojoman said: that is no argument, it is not a problem.
2011-08-06 11:05:46	nadir	He made a long post what might stay, what would be needed to changed.
2011-08-06 11:05:52	nadir	it is still not changed.
2011-08-06 11:06:33	nadir	that is one example, but its in general like that. they are moderators
2011-08-06 11:06:44	nadir	(as its a small forum, there is not much, but stilll)
2011-08-06 11:08:21	nadir	they made a new group, without a) discussion of any kind or b) announcing it.
2011-08-06 11:08:28	nadir	last week.
2011-08-06 11:08:56	@telemachus	group?
2011-08-06 11:09:11	nadir	ex-moderators can now access the hidden area.
2011-08-06 11:09:22	nadir	forgot the name of the group, but i am part of it.
2011-08-06 11:09:29	nadir	and no, i don't visit the hidden area.
2011-08-06 11:10:40	@telemachus	hidden area?
2011-08-06 11:11:26	nadir	moderators discussion what is going on area.
2011-08-06 11:11:52	nadir	because there was too much discussion someone came up with the idea to
2011-08-06 11:12:07	nadir	prepare it, results, in that area, and them throw them at the users.
2011-08-06 11:12:29	nadir	which, as far i can tell, does not exist at forums debian net.
2011-08-06 11:13:24	nadir	which means, imho, that you can post half-naked women, but
2011-08-06 11:13:33	nadir	in general it is not better than forums debian net.
2011-08-06 11:13:53	nadir	if i want to see half naked women i see no reason to go to a forum...
2011-08-06 11:15:47	nadir	.
2011-08-06 11:16:02	@telemachus	yeah
2011-08-06 11:16:06	nadir	can i test pod/vim by simply opening "vim README.pod" from plexus?
2011-08-06 11:16:07	@telemachus	weird
2011-08-06 11:16:20	@telemachus	nadir, you don't even need a real pod file
2011-08-06 11:16:20	nadir	yes, you told something like that, long ago.
2011-08-06 11:16:27	@telemachus	just type vim foo.pod
2011-08-06 11:16:32	@telemachus	then type set filetype
2011-08-06 11:16:33	nadir	i only checked the thread by dbb0
2011-08-06 11:16:35	@telemachus	and see what it says
2011-08-06 11:16:58	nadir	set filetype to what
2011-08-06 11:17:41	nadir	well: if only that is says: -> filetype=pod
2011-08-06 11:18:10	@telemachus	yup
2011-08-06 11:18:13	nadir	but my syntax highlightin is fine.
2011-08-06 11:18:17	nadir	as far i can tell.
2011-08-06 11:18:36	@telemachus	works for you if it says filetype=pod
2011-08-06 11:18:50	@telemachus	ok, I apologize, but I'm running out to the silly movie
2011-08-06 11:18:51	@telemachus	later guys
2011-08-06 11:18:57	nadir	later. have fun
2011-08-06 11:32:31	@telemachus	later
2011-08-06 11:34:48	dbb0	it turns out it was a plugin, as t suspected
2011-08-06 11:35:57	nadir	but it works now, i suspect?
2011-08-06 11:37:21	dbb0	yeah
2011-08-06 11:50:46	dbb0	what projects are you working on these days
2011-08-06 11:51:24	nadir	nothing. really.
2011-08-06 11:51:31	nadir	fooling around a bit.
2011-08-06 11:52:02	nadir	makes me feel bad, always, but i got problems to focus on serious "work".
2011-08-06 11:52:17	nadir	the last thing i did was mysql and related apps.
2011-08-06 11:52:52	nadir	i would love to start testing plexus, and i would love to get serious with pyblosxom (add some plugins)
2011-08-06 11:53:11	nadir	and... i want to install scuttle to the server (-> sweaty hands)
2011-08-06 11:53:15	dbb0	is pyblosxom dead too
2011-08-06 11:53:39	nadir	i don't think so, but am not sure. At least you will find plugins, an IRC-channel, etc.
2011-08-06 11:57:07	dbb0	scuttle looks cool
2011-08-06 11:57:18	dbb0	semantic scuttle even cooler
2011-08-06 11:57:54	nadir	i tried it in Vbox, and i could get it sorted.
2011-08-06 11:58:20	nadir	but moving mysql/php/whatnot to the server is giving me bad feelings (as i barely know it)
2011-08-06 11:58:53	nadir	ah, btw, delicious is the default bookmarking site one uses?
2011-08-06 11:59:12	nadir	i started making an account, then read "yahoo", and stopped.
2011-08-06 12:40:07	dbb0	delicious is probably the most popular
2011-08-06 12:40:31	nadir	ok, thanks
2011-08-06 12:43:11	dbb0	there's also diingo, which took over furl
2011-08-06 12:43:22	dbb0	mister wong, based in germany i believe
2011-08-06 12:44:21	nadir	in the early days of my computing i ran into mr.wong all the time.
2011-08-06 12:46:01	dbb0	mybookmarks.com looks like its from 1998
2011-08-06 12:47:15	nadir	what i need is something to get used to tagging.
2011-08-06 12:47:22	dbb0	diigo*
2011-08-06 12:47:27	dbb0	not diingo
2011-08-06 12:47:38		irc: disconnected from server

2011-08-06 12:56:27	nadir	oh
2011-08-06 12:56:40	nadir	i kinda liked dbbolton... as a name, i mean.
2011-08-06 12:57:34	dbb0	eh, i decided to avoid showing my last name whenever possible
2011-08-06 12:57:50	nadir	yup.
2011-08-06 12:58:07	nadir	but on the bad side that broke my bookmark for iceweasel and my git too...
2011-08-06 12:58:08	nadir	ha ha.
2011-08-06 13:02:00	nadir	all repaired.
2011-08-06 13:04:52	dbb0	yeah, i have to go through all local git dirs and change the username
2011-08-06 13:07:18	nadir	i hate the autocommenting. for me it only happens in perl
2011-08-06 13:07:38	nadir	but i don't hate it enough to look into a solution.

2011-08-06 13:31:05	fsmithred	hi
2011-08-06 13:31:24	fsmithred	what's happening?
2011-08-06 13:31:48	nadir	slowly falling of the chair...
2011-08-06 13:31:53	fsmithred	oops
2011-08-06 13:31:57	nadir	but i assume  that was not the question.
2011-08-06 13:32:00	nadir	so: i did tests.
2011-08-06 13:32:03	fsmithred	cool
2011-08-06 13:32:04	fsmithred	thanks
2011-08-06 13:32:07	nadir	np.
2011-08-06 13:32:12	nadir	in general: works.
2011-08-06 13:32:13	fsmithred	what'd you find out
2011-08-06 13:32:21	nadir	i did a fresh VBox install
2011-08-06 13:32:37	nadir	i ran the new snapshot. worked.
2011-08-06 13:32:52	nadir	i removed a few apps, ran the new snapshot. worked.
2011-08-06 13:33:05	nadir	i ran snapshot, but set it to use ~/user/work
2011-08-06 13:33:10	nadir	and ~/user/snapshot
2011-08-06 13:33:12	nadir	worked too.
2011-08-06 13:33:17	nadir	that were all tests i did.
2011-08-06 13:33:26	fsmithred	ok, that's good
2011-08-06 13:34:28	fsmithred	pretty sure I'm gonna get rid of the options window
2011-08-06 13:34:57	nadir	yes, thats good.
2011-08-06 13:34:57	nadir	what is strange is that i still get the following error message while booting the live-CD:
2011-08-06 13:34:57	nadir	- /etc/init.d/live.config line 33 /lib/config.sh Not found
2011-08-06 13:34:59	nadir	yes?
2011-08-06 13:34:59	fsmithred	then only use the config file for custom settings
2011-08-06 13:35:09	fsmithred	at boot?
2011-08-06 13:35:11	nadir	and instead of that do it via editing
2011-08-06 13:35:15	nadir	yes, after:
2011-08-06 13:35:15	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-06 13:35:17	nadir	Loading ...
2011-08-06 13:35:19	dbb0	hey fsmithred 
2011-08-06 13:35:23	fsmithred	hi dbb0
2011-08-06 13:35:31	fsmithred	yeah, only edit config file
2011-08-06 13:35:38	nadir	ah, ok.
2011-08-06 13:35:52	fsmithred	that way, nobody can end up selecting the same location for work_dir and snapshot_dir
2011-08-06 13:36:06	fsmithred	I don't have to crowd my windows with lots of instructions
2011-08-06 13:36:07	nadir	i searched for the error. All i can find is a very old post at the live-helper mailing list.
2011-08-06 13:36:13	nadir	its not relevant anymore.
2011-08-06 13:36:17	fsmithred	and I can put lots of instructions in the comments in the config file
2011-08-06 13:36:25	fsmithred	yeah, I think that error is normal
2011-08-06 13:36:33	nadir	ah. ok.
2011-08-06 13:36:38	fsmithred	and it's because live-build is not installed
2011-08-06 13:36:54	nadir	so i will try to install live-build.
2011-08-06 13:36:55	fsmithred	if you install that, it the message goes away
2011-08-06 13:36:58	fsmithred	I think
2011-08-06 13:37:02	fsmithred	um
2011-08-06 13:37:02	nadir	as long it only spits itself out:ok.
2011-08-06 13:37:12	nadir	but if i run in my kernel panic again...
2011-08-06 13:37:17	fsmithred	I ran apt-file to see what package contains the file that's mentioned
2011-08-06 13:37:32	fsmithred	pretty sure it was in live-build, which isn't needed
2011-08-06 13:38:36	fsmithred	anyway, I want to keep it simple
2011-08-06 13:38:41	fsmithred	and easy to maintain
2011-08-06 13:39:02	fsmithred	thought about adding code to make sure you don't put snapshot and work in the same place
2011-08-06 13:39:04	fsmithred	but fuck it
2011-08-06 13:39:14	nadir	that is the spirit.
2011-08-06 13:39:16	nadir	really.
2011-08-06 13:39:23	fsmithred	I can be verbose in the config file
2011-08-06 13:39:47	fsmithred	and anyone who's interested in changing settings can sit there and read it as many times as they want until it makes sense
2011-08-06 13:40:26	fsmithred	next thing to work on is progress bars for rsync and genisoimage
2011-08-06 13:40:27	nadir	yup, or ask.
2011-08-06 13:40:41	fsmithred	and maybe get rid of the terminal altogether
2011-08-06 13:40:45	fsmithred	not sure if that'll work
2011-08-06 13:40:45	nadir	speaking of progress,
2011-08-06 13:40:49	fsmithred	?
2011-08-06 13:40:53	nadir	why did you write: 1111111
2011-08-06 13:40:56	nadir	like that?
2011-08-06 13:41:10	nadir	the output of the terminal, when running snapshot.
2011-08-06 13:42:01	fsmithred	I was trying to see how far into that function it got before it died
2011-08-06 13:42:11	fsmithred	trying to find a syntax error
2011-08-06 13:42:25	nadir	ah, ok
2011-08-06 13:42:26	fsmithred	I think there might be a better way, but I don't know it
2011-08-06 13:42:58	fsmithred	bash error messages aren't very helpful
2011-08-06 13:43:28	fsmithred	I'll clean that stuff out
2011-08-06 13:44:18	dbb0	are you guys talking about perl
2011-08-06 13:44:27	dbb0	the syntax error i mean
2011-08-06 13:44:33	fsmithred	no
2011-08-06 13:44:34	fsmithred	bash
2011-08-06 13:44:39	fsmithred	perl has good error messages
2011-08-06 13:44:55	fsmithred	perl will not lie to you about which line contains the error
2011-08-06 13:44:56	dbb0	even better: perl -c -T file.pl
2011-08-06 13:45:16	fsmithred	what's -c and -T?
2011-08-06 13:48:22	fsmithred	or...
2011-08-06 13:48:30	fsmithred	where can I read about command line options
2011-08-06 13:48:36	fsmithred	since they're not in the man page?
2011-08-06 13:50:12	fsmithred	am I still here?
2011-08-06 13:50:24	dbb0	perlrun
2011-08-06 13:50:40	nadir	perl --help seems to help too.
2011-08-06 13:50:46	dbb0	perldoc perlrun
2011-08-06 13:50:57	dbb0	perldoc is your friend
2011-08-06 13:50:58	nadir	for -c -T
2011-08-06 13:51:12	dbb0	it's less verbose
2011-08-06 13:52:02	fsmithred	ok, check syntax and check taint (gotta laugh at that one)
2011-08-06 13:53:50	fsmithred	I need to go make some coffee and a sandwich
2011-08-06 13:54:03	fsmithred	nadir, you gonna hold up for a little while longer?
2011-08-06 13:54:11	nadir	ok.
2011-08-06 13:54:26	fsmithred	I'll be about 10-15 minutes
2011-08-06 13:54:34	nadir	ok, fine for me
2011-08-06 13:54:34	fsmithred	15 at most
2011-08-06 13:54:37	fsmithred	cool
2011-08-06 13:54:39	fsmithred	brb
2011-08-06 13:56:25	dbb0	nadir: 'taint' is a slang term for perineum
2011-08-06 13:56:38	dbb0	damm
2011-08-06 13:56:52	nadir	perineum?
2011-08-06 13:56:57	nadir	i got to ask the Greek
2011-08-06 13:57:04	nadir	!tr en de perineum
2011-08-06 13:57:04	@antinoos	Damm
2011-08-06 13:57:09	nadir	lol
2011-08-06 14:02:54	dbb0	so what are you and fred doing now
2011-08-06 14:03:16	nadir	i am doing the guinea pig
2011-08-06 14:03:39	nadir	he is fiddling with a tool to make snapshots of an installation, which will result in a live-CD
2011-08-06 14:03:54	nadir	but that is bash.
2011-08-06 14:04:12	nadir	i got hard times to read code which is more than a block
2011-08-06 14:04:31	dbb0	refracta?
2011-08-06 14:04:39	nadir	yes.
2011-08-06 14:09:07	fsmithred	back
2011-08-06 14:09:16	nadir	good
2011-08-06 14:09:20	dbb0	for i in $(find . -type f); { perl -i.bak -pe 's/dbbolton/dbb/g' "$i" }
2011-08-06 14:09:26	fsmithred	taint...
2011-08-06 14:09:30	dbb0	fixed all my username problems
2011-08-06 14:09:45	fsmithred	'taint ass, 'taint cunt, but you know when you hit it.
2011-08-06 14:09:56	dbb0	lol
2011-08-06 14:10:00	fsmithred	'taint = it ain't
2011-08-06 14:11:18	dbb0	i guess i'm sort of from the south so i picked up on that
2011-08-06 14:11:54	fsmithred	yeah, I did that for nadir's benefit
2011-08-06 14:11:58	fsmithred	I figured you knew it
2011-08-06 14:12:05	nadir	yup, i would have missed it.
2011-08-06 14:13:51	nadir	ok, here is a little quote from linuxquestions.org. Have fun:
2011-08-06 14:13:52	fsmithred	nadir, you still using pybosxom?
2011-08-06 14:13:57	nadir	Debian looks very simple gui, not beautiful.
2011-08-06 14:13:57	nadir	Can we make it stylish and beautiful, using themes?
2011-08-06 14:14:05	nadir	yes, i think i will stick to it.
2011-08-06 14:14:12	fsmithred	ok, I'll install it
2011-08-06 14:14:16	nadir	i wanted to figure out how to use plugins, but lost controll
2011-08-06 14:14:29	nadir	-> focus problems
2011-08-06 14:15:30	fsmithred	so that poster needs to see the thread about what your desktop looks like
2011-08-06 14:16:00	nadir	yup, seem so.
2011-08-06 14:16:17	nadir	well: space-fuck is sure a surprise.
2011-08-06 14:16:35	nadir	i would sure have removed Debian immediatly if i would have seen that.
2011-08-06 14:16:41	fsmithred	have to agree with him that the default debian desktop is not beautiful
2011-08-06 14:16:48	fsmithred	in fact, I think it's butt ugly
2011-08-06 14:16:57	nadir	i liked, wait, what was the default for lenny?
2011-08-06 14:17:04	nadir	got it: moreblue
2011-08-06 14:17:23	fsmithred	I want less blue, thanks
2011-08-06 14:17:34	nadir	oh
2011-08-06 14:17:41	fsmithred	sick of blue desktops
2011-08-06 14:18:12	fsmithred	been looking at blue themes since windows 95
2011-08-06 14:18:34	nadir	ah. well: i went from default etch to lenny, and that was amazing
2011-08-06 14:18:37	fsmithred	only good thing about blue is that it's not brown
2011-08-06 14:18:44	nadir	before that, buntu and mandriva, i can't remember.
2011-08-06 14:19:16	fsmithred	I looked at mandrive some time in the past year
2011-08-06 14:19:25	nadir	and?
2011-08-06 14:19:28	fsmithred	desktop was blue, but it was definitely stylish
2011-08-06 14:19:33	fsmithred	nice artwork
2011-08-06 14:19:46	fsmithred	two things I didn't like about mandriva
2011-08-06 14:20:01	fsmithred	partition tool doesn't have a warning before it does something...
2011-08-06 14:20:12	fsmithred	"I'm really gonna do this now, ok?"
2011-08-06 14:20:18	fsmithred	would be nice
2011-08-06 14:20:34	nadir	"nice" is a very friendly version
2011-08-06 14:20:35	fsmithred	in case you accidentally click on the wrong partition
2011-08-06 14:20:40	fsmithred	lol
2011-08-06 14:21:00	fsmithred	and it would also be nice if the desktop sound didn't play at full volume
2011-08-06 14:21:07	fsmithred	I about jumped out of my skin
2011-08-06 14:21:20	nadir	ah, about that i don't remember at all. perhaps i had not boxes attached.
2011-08-06 14:21:35	fsmithred	I had my stereo attached
2011-08-06 14:22:28	nadir	you got any interest in running ppc-debian in qemu?
2011-08-06 14:23:15	fsmithred	omg
2011-08-06 14:23:17	fsmithred	not really
2011-08-06 14:23:25	fsmithred	you need something tested?
2011-08-06 14:23:38	nadir	(the dude who asked if one is able to change themes for Debian is registered since .... 6 years, 1500 posts...)
2011-08-06 14:23:46	fsmithred	wtf?
2011-08-06 14:23:56	nadir	no. i thought it ~might~ be you would like to run ppc once.
2011-08-06 14:24:00	nadir	i found a how-to.
2011-08-06 14:24:06	fsmithred	and he's never clicked on "settings"?
2011-08-06 14:24:09	nadir	but, seriously, once installed its Debian
2011-08-06 14:24:13	nadir	yup. very strange.
2011-08-06 14:24:27	nadir	like in: i barely can believe it.
2011-08-06 14:24:38	fsmithred	I just don't like to use qemu - too slow
2011-08-06 14:24:43	nadir	and its not that hard in gnome
2011-08-06 14:24:46	nadir	yup
2011-08-06 14:25:29	nadir	iirc there is even a button who lets you download new themes online (?)
2011-08-06 14:26:39	fsmithred	login themes
2011-08-06 14:27:20	nadir	ah, login themes. I got to say: the refracta gdm-theme is really nice, specially in fullscreen (no-VBox)
2011-08-06 14:27:44	fsmithred	glad you like it
2011-08-06 14:27:57	fsmithred	I want to make the name smaller
2011-08-06 14:28:13	nadir	as for desktop: i change gtk to Albatross (sp) and window-manager to default.
2011-08-06 14:28:36	nadir	i think it comes with murrine (Albatross, but its there per default)
2011-08-06 14:28:42	fsmithred	yeah, I included murrine
2011-08-06 14:31:46	fsmithred	cool, pyblosxom is working
2011-08-06 14:31:52	fsmithred	took me two minutes
2011-08-06 14:32:57	⇦	nadir (~markus@g224155044.adsl.alicedsl.de) has quit (Read error: Operation timed out)
2011-08-06 14:33:05	fsmithred	does it have its own flavours files?
2011-08-06 14:33:07	fsmithred	shit
2011-08-06 14:42:31	fsmithred	!memo nadir I went out for a smoke
2011-08-06 14:42:31	@antinoos	Added memo for nadir
2011-08-06 14:42:41	fsmithred	dbb0, I'm going outside for a smoke
2011-08-06 14:46:41	⇨	nadir (~markus@g224154173.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #study-group
2011-08-06 14:50:17	nadir	mhh....
2011-08-06 14:50:18	@antinoos	<fsmithred/#study-group/2011-08-06> I went out for a smoke
2011-08-06 14:50:23	nadir	ah. oh, uh
2011-08-06 14:53:43	fsmithred	back
2011-08-06 14:53:52	nadir	did i went offline?
2011-08-06 14:53:55	fsmithred	yes
2011-08-06 14:54:06	nadir	aha. did not know. a little info would be cool
2011-08-06 14:54:11	fsmithred	you got back on without loggin in again?
2011-08-06 14:54:17	nadir	yup
2011-08-06 14:54:23	nadir	it gets silent. thats all
2011-08-06 14:54:26	fsmithred	hm
2011-08-06 14:54:34	fsmithred	maybe that should have a bug report
2011-08-06 14:54:35	nadir	i think: no one posts, thats all. happens all the itme.
2011-08-06 14:54:50	fsmithred	I asked if I was still online a little while ago for same reason
2011-08-06 14:54:54	nadir	mhh... never thought of that.
2011-08-06 14:54:55	fsmithred	turns out I was still here
2011-08-06 14:55:29	fsmithred	same flavour files for blosxom and pyblosxom work
2011-08-06 14:55:35	fsmithred	that's nice
2011-08-06 14:55:38	nadir	did you read my question if you are busy with refracta-tools in the near future?
2011-08-06 14:56:06	nadir	huh? same flavour files?
2011-08-06 14:56:28	fsmithred	yeah - I had to add a line to the config file
2011-08-06 14:57:17	fsmithred	py["flavourdir"] = "/path/to/flavours"
2011-08-06 14:57:32	nadir	and you remember which was /path/to ?
2011-08-06 14:57:46	fsmithred	I used ~/blosxom/flavours
2011-08-06 14:57:59	fsmithred	same datadir works
2011-08-06 14:58:10	fsmithred	I actually have blosxom and pyblosxom installed
2011-08-06 14:58:22	fsmithred	and both scripts in my public_html/cgi-bin/
2011-08-06 14:58:28	fsmithred	can use either one
2011-08-06 14:58:33	nadir	yup
2011-08-06 14:58:52	nadir	do locate flavour | grep pyblosxom, there is a neverending path...
2011-08-06 14:59:28	nadir	and i put those in my blog-dir, inside of flavour, did not work.
2011-08-06 14:59:47	nadir	so now i got all of them at the top-level, which is not very clear (the structure)
2011-08-06 15:00:09	fsmithred	ew
2011-08-06 15:00:29	fsmithred	add the line to /etc/pyblosxom/config.py
2011-08-06 15:00:48	nadir	ah, it ain't there, to edit, but i need to add it?
2011-08-06 15:00:51	fsmithred	use $datadir/flavours
2011-08-06 15:00:58	fsmithred	yeah, you have to add it
2011-08-06 15:01:01	nadir	fuck that.
2011-08-06 15:01:05	nadir	but thanks a ton.
2011-08-06 15:01:14	fsmithred	I googled for pyblosxom flavours to find it
2011-08-06 15:01:44	nadir	that is the dir i meant:
2011-08-06 15:01:48	nadir	/usr/share/python-support/pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/flavours/html.flav/
2011-08-06 15:02:16	fsmithred	oh, you have your datadir there?
2011-08-06 15:03:07	nadir	~/Documents/blog
2011-08-06 15:03:22	nadir	there is flavour (which did not work), and the txt-files
2011-08-06 15:03:32	fsmithred	so ~/Documents/blog/flavours would be the preferred location
2011-08-06 15:03:45	fsmithred	yeah, but you didn't have the line in the config file
2011-08-06 15:03:57	fsmithred	you need that
2011-08-06 15:04:22	nadir	py["flavour_dir"] = "/home/molloy/Documents/blog/flavour"
2011-08-06 15:04:33	nadir	like that?
2011-08-06 15:06:57	fsmithred	py["flavourdir"] =
2011-08-06 15:07:07	fsmithred	the rest looks good
2011-08-06 15:08:00	nadir	ok, got it running. thanks
2011-08-06 15:08:27	nadir	first i had an s too much (flavours instead of flavour)
2011-08-06 15:08:37	nadir	puh.
2011-08-06 15:09:03	nadir	but besides that switching from one to the other is ok. quite similar
2011-08-06 15:10:04	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-06 15:10:12	fsmithred	ok what was your refracta question?
2011-08-06 15:10:33	nadir	ah, my question is if your plan is to keep on working at the refracta tools
2011-08-06 15:10:42	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-06 15:10:45	nadir	in the near future (the next days/weeks/years)
2011-08-06 15:10:45	nadir	ok
2011-08-06 15:10:50	fsmithred	near future
2011-08-06 15:11:01	fsmithred	I started putting together the copyright file
2011-08-06 15:11:04	nadir	i got hard times to do coding right now.
2011-08-06 15:11:13	fsmithred	heh, me too
2011-08-06 15:11:23	fsmithred	I just started watching a friend's kids during the day
2011-08-06 15:11:26	nadir	well: it fits then.
2011-08-06 15:11:38	nadir	ah, and?
2011-08-06 15:11:40	fsmithred	I can't hide in my room all day on the computer
2011-08-06 15:11:53	fsmithred	and pretty much have to be outside, since there's a lake
2011-08-06 15:12:07	fsmithred	and they can play in the water all day without getting tired
2011-08-06 15:12:17	fsmithred	yesterday was first day I did it
2011-08-06 15:12:18	nadir	so you need a laptop. :-)
2011-08-06 15:12:33	fsmithred	so I might be babbling incoherently by the end of next week
2011-08-06 15:12:43	fsmithred	yeah, a laptop would help a lot
2011-08-06 15:13:03	fsmithred	I could maybe retrieve my almost-a-laptop from storage
2011-08-06 15:13:22	fsmithred	stick the wireless nic back into it
2011-08-06 15:13:25	nadir	i for one can't work good if people are around.
2011-08-06 15:13:27	fsmithred	and just use an extension cord
2011-08-06 15:13:30	fsmithred	agree
2011-08-06 15:13:39	fsmithred	plus
2011-08-06 15:13:44	fsmithred	if I'm on computer...
2011-08-06 15:13:52	fsmithred	there will be trouble
2011-08-06 15:14:01	fsmithred	because the older one will want to use a computer
2011-08-06 15:14:07	nadir	ah, i see.
2011-08-06 15:14:08	fsmithred	to watch youtube
2011-08-06 15:14:22	nadir	what? youtube? show him pornhub
2011-08-06 15:14:23	fsmithred	I don't think she'll understand the concept of "work"
2011-08-06 15:14:27	fsmithred	her
2011-08-06 15:14:31	nadir	then her.
2011-08-06 15:14:32	fsmithred	eight-year-old girl
2011-08-06 15:14:36	fsmithred	um, no thanks
2011-08-06 15:14:38	nadir	ok, that might be a bit early
2011-08-06 15:14:44	fsmithred	I don't want to have to live under a bridge
2011-08-06 15:14:49	nadir	lol
2011-08-06 15:15:33	nadir	well: i assume its fun too, and doing PC stuff is just one thing.
2011-08-06 15:15:44	nadir	i like it alot if children are around
2011-08-06 15:16:39	fsmithred	grep -l exlcudes * | wc -l
2011-08-06 15:16:48	fsmithred	23
2011-08-06 15:17:07	fsmithred	that's how many files have excludes spelled wrong
2011-08-06 15:17:10	nadir	in one exlcudes file you got /live, but that is an old directory
2011-08-06 15:17:20	nadir	ah, fuh, i misunderstood.
2011-08-06 15:17:36	fsmithred	there's no /live?
2011-08-06 15:17:39	nadir	nope
2011-08-06 15:17:50	nadir	its an old dir, where Dean made the snapshot.
2011-08-06 15:17:51	nadir	iirc
2011-08-06 15:17:58	nadir	before python, i think
2011-08-06 15:18:17	nadir	just check, or just leave it, doesn't seem to hurt
2011-08-06 15:18:24	fsmithred	I'm checking
2011-08-06 15:18:28	fsmithred	have to boot iso
2011-08-06 15:18:34	fsmithred	I think that's where is it
2011-08-06 15:18:34	nadir	oh.
2011-08-06 15:18:37	fsmithred	it is
2011-08-06 15:18:44	fsmithred	fucking disobedient fingers
2011-08-06 15:18:47	nadir	huh?
2011-08-06 15:18:59	fsmithred	s/is it/it is/
2011-08-06 15:19:13	nadir	so you got a /live ?
2011-08-06 15:19:24	nadir	or the iso is there?
2011-08-06 15:19:38	fsmithred	if you boot the cd (or iso) there's a /live
2011-08-06 15:20:00	fsmithred	and someone might want to make a snapshot from the live cd
2011-08-06 15:20:16	nadir	aha. ok, sorry, my fault.
2011-08-06 15:20:17	fsmithred	just have to use some mounted storage for work and snapshot dirs
2011-08-06 15:20:18	fsmithred	np
2011-08-06 15:20:47	nadir	a snapshot from a live CD, now you talk the geek talk
2011-08-06 15:20:54	nadir	what comes next?
2011-08-06 15:21:08	nadir	via net?
2011-08-06 15:21:14	fsmithred	fix all my spelling errors
2011-08-06 15:22:29	nadir	the exlcudes was not easy to see.
2011-08-06 15:22:55	nadir	also the initrd. with img missing (iirc)
2011-08-06 15:23:07	nadir	you look, you think: all good.
2011-08-06 15:23:27	fsmithred	yup
2011-08-06 15:24:14	nadir	i think i am moving a bit towards web-stuff.
2011-08-06 15:24:31	nadir	like pyblosxom,bit of html, wee bit of css.
2011-08-06 15:24:42	nadir	and what dbb0 proposed (markdown)
2011-08-06 15:26:02	fsmithred	well...
2011-08-06 15:26:07	fsmithred	for all those text files
2011-08-06 15:26:20	fsmithred	I like <pre> ... </pre>
2011-08-06 15:26:28	fsmithred	way too easy
2011-08-06 15:27:11	nadir	i think i like it too.
2011-08-06 15:27:28	nadir	the font changes, i read to which font, but its really easy.
2011-08-06 15:30:05	nadir	found it: Courier
2011-08-06 15:30:10	fsmithred	yuk
2011-08-06 15:34:21	fsmithred	yeah, that looks like courier
2011-08-06 15:34:34	fsmithred	doesn't look as bad as I expected
2011-08-06 15:34:43	fsmithred	oh
2011-08-06 15:34:51	fsmithred	didn't get bold on the first line
2011-08-06 15:34:59	fsmithred	have to leave that outside the tags
2011-08-06 15:35:33	nadir	i can't say it looks bad, but a bit too small.
2011-08-06 15:36:43	fsmithred	what's the default font without those tags?
2011-08-06 15:36:52	fsmithred	browser default?
2011-08-06 15:37:42	nadir	now that is a good question
2011-08-06 15:37:44	fsmithred	serif?
2011-08-06 15:38:01	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-06 15:38:05	fsmithred	I just changed it in ff
2011-08-06 15:38:23	fsmithred	serif 16
2011-08-06 15:38:32	fsmithred	didn't even have to go into advanced
2011-08-06 15:39:26	fsmithred	hm, posting times aren't showing up next to the link
2011-08-06 15:39:38	fsmithred	probably need to tweak the flavour file
2011-08-06 15:40:27	nadir	http://resident.dyndns.info/~molloy/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi
2011-08-06 15:40:42	nadir	scroll down, posting time shows up.
2011-08-06 15:41:03	nadir	and i did not change anything, its from the said /path/to/pyblosxom/flavours
2011-08-06 15:41:30	fsmithred	you got a story.html in flavours?
2011-08-06 15:41:43	nadir	wait, i need to ssh
2011-08-06 15:42:11	nadir	yes.
2011-08-06 15:42:16	nadir	content_type.html  date_head.html  head.html
2011-08-06 15:42:16	nadir	date_foot.html     foot.html       story.html
2011-08-06 15:42:27	nadir	most of them i got not clue what they are good for.
2011-08-06 15:42:37	fsmithred	oh, what's in date_foot.html?
2011-08-06 15:42:42	nadir	I would also like to use css instead of doing it inside of them
2011-08-06 15:42:43	fsmithred	or end of story.html
2011-08-06 15:42:49	nadir	wait, slow.
2011-08-06 15:42:54	nadir	what? both?
2011-08-06 15:42:58	fsmithred	<i>posted at: $hr:$min [<a href="$url$path">$path</a>]
2011-08-06 15:43:03	fsmithred	that's in my story.html
2011-08-06 15:43:11	fsmithred	I tweaked that from whatever it was before
2011-08-06 15:43:12	nadir	i think its in foot. sec
2011-08-06 15:43:19	fsmithred	and it worked in blosxom
2011-08-06 15:43:40	fsmithred	but the $hr and $min are defined in the perl script
2011-08-06 15:44:41	nadir	story.html http://paste.debian.net/125306/
2011-08-06 15:45:12	nadir	/usr/share/python-support/pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/flavours/html.flav
2011-08-06 15:45:18	nadir	which might be more easy.
2011-08-06 15:47:24	fsmithred	just html.flav there
2011-08-06 15:47:44	fsmithred	I have to go cook hamburgers
2011-08-06 15:47:52	fsmithred	I've been elected for the job
2011-08-06 15:48:03	fsmithred	can get these from you later
2011-08-06 15:48:06	nadir	good.
2011-08-06 15:48:12	nadir	i have to eat too. :-)
2011-08-06 15:48:13	fsmithred	or maybe tar up your flavour files and mail them
2011-08-06 15:48:27	fsmithred	ok, I gotta run
2011-08-06 15:48:29	nadir	ok, i will do that. strange you ain't got them.
2011-08-06 15:48:30	nadir	later.

2011-08-07 11:16:06	nadir	hi, will you be here in half an hour?
2011-08-07 11:16:21	nadir	i had problems with nexus, but have to cook
2011-08-07 11:17:00	dbb0	plexus?
2011-08-07 11:17:05	nadir	yup
2011-08-07 11:17:09	nadir	Use of uninitialized value $content in concatenation (.) or string at plexus.pl line 314.
2011-08-07 11:17:12	dbb0	yeah, probablu
2011-08-07 11:17:21	nadir	should be line 300 in your version, i made some comments/notes
2011-08-07 11:17:39	nadir	i tried to get my head into it, but all i got was headaches...
2011-08-07 11:17:40	dbb0	make a gist will all your files
2011-08-07 11:17:47	dbb0	ill look into it
2011-08-07 11:17:50	nadir	wait.
2011-08-07 11:18:05	nadir	i only git pulled your stuff, and ran "perl plexus.pl" as a first test.
2011-08-07 11:18:11	nadir	it did work a few days ago.
2011-08-07 11:18:45	dbb0	ok
2011-08-07 11:18:50	dbb0	ill check it out
2011-08-07 11:18:57	nadir	so its the same, exactly, with what you got at github, but i got "user 5.012_003
2011-08-07 11:19:17	nadir	and, btw, respect. looks really cool, aka sexy.
2011-08-07 11:19:20	nadir	very clear and all.
2011-08-07 11:21:00	dbb0	what about your working dir? it exists and has all the files?
2011-08-07 11:21:19	nadir	i hope yes. i checked several times. wait.
2011-08-07 11:21:34	nadir	what you mean, all files?
2011-08-07 11:21:46	nadir	i have the working dir, left to default, but its empty.
2011-08-07 11:22:11	dbb0	that's the problem i bet
2011-08-07 11:22:21	dbb0	you need your template files in that dir
2011-08-07 11:22:41	nadir	ah, ok, yup.
2011-08-07 11:22:43	dbb0	change "working_dir = path_to_clone"
2011-08-07 11:22:51	nadir	i changed "working dir " to .
2011-08-07 11:22:54	nadir	and it works again.
2011-08-07 11:22:57	nadir	cool bean.
2011-08-07 11:23:03	dbb0	cool
2011-08-07 11:23:20	nadir	ok, so : first step. Now let me play with it.
2011-08-07 11:23:24	nadir	and for markdown:
2011-08-07 11:23:35	nadir	i can quit it all, just make some breaks, ...
2011-08-07 11:23:41	nadir	until i got my head into its syntax.
2011-08-07 11:24:07	nadir	(well: i will see if i can or can not do that)
2011-08-07 11:24:12	dbb0	i think the syntax is straightforward
2011-08-07 11:24:20	dbb0	really similar to wiki mark up
2011-08-07 11:24:31	dbb0	but i edit wikipedia pages like there's no tomorrow
2011-08-07 11:24:34	nadir	which i don'T know neither....
2011-08-07 11:24:54	nadir	but in some time, i should be up to it.
2011-08-07 11:25:08	nadir	you edit wikipedia?
2011-08-07 11:25:37	dbb0	wikipedia, wikimedia, wiktionary
2011-08-07 11:25:48	nadir	wow. good spirit.
2011-08-07 11:25:58	dbb0	sometimes in german too, if i see a typo or something. not much writing
2011-08-07 11:26:27	nadir	interesting the english and the german articles are often very different.
2011-08-07 11:26:33	nadir	often worth to switch.

2011-08-07 11:27:39	dbb0	let me guess: the meat is pork

2011-08-07 12:14:15	nadir	i moved pyblosxomo around and finally it did not work at all.
2011-08-07 12:14:16	fsmithred	I tried index last night, but I have no clue how to get it to work

2011-08-07 12:14:52	nadir	so that is the first thing i need to get sorted.
2011-08-07 12:15:04		[dbb0 away: shower]
2011-08-07 12:15:31	nadir	what i understood is that you enable "plugdir" and put the plugs in the directory you said,
2011-08-07 12:15:33	nadir	and thats it.
2011-08-07 12:15:41	nadir	but it is never-ever: thats it.
2011-08-07 12:16:05	fsmithred	# What should this blog use as its base url?

2011-08-07 12:16:20	nadir	no idea, sorry.
2011-08-07 12:16:51	fsmithred	yeah, I understand the basics of plugins
2011-08-07 12:17:07	fsmithred	but individual plugins have their own instructions
2011-08-07 12:17:12	fsmithred	usually inside the plugin file
2011-08-07 12:17:14	nadir	yup, i haven't edited it (but i think i did with blosxom...)
2011-08-07 12:17:20	fsmithred	and maybe they're in this one, but I don't understand it
2011-08-07 12:17:33	fsmithred	got it to kill the blog

2011-08-07 12:18:11	nadir	let me try.

2011-08-07 12:25:28	nadir	no clue, still server error.
2011-08-07 12:25:45	fsmithred	server error where?
2011-08-07 12:25:47	nadir	i can run it from ~/public_html, but not from /var/www
2011-08-07 12:25:51	fsmithred	I'm looking at your blog
2011-08-07 12:25:54	fsmithred	oh, ok
2011-08-07 12:25:57	nadir	no, at the PC
2011-08-07 12:26:23	fsmithred	gotta be a pyblosxom setting
2011-08-07 12:26:33	nadir	when i disable plugin dir it works
2011-08-07 12:26:36	nadir	voila.
2011-08-07 12:27:08	fsmithred	hey, when I go to main server address, I get your page
2011-08-07 12:27:22	fsmithred	then when I click on "misc stuff"
2011-08-07 12:27:28	fsmithred	I go to ~/molloy
2011-08-07 12:28:01	fsmithred	so, your main index is showing up in the right place, but the links in the page are pointing to what's in public_html
2011-08-07 12:28:03	fsmithred	I think
2011-08-07 12:29:07	fsmithred	http://resident.dyndns.info/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi
2011-08-07 12:29:10	fsmithred	that works
2011-08-07 12:29:17	fsmithred	I had to edit the url
2011-08-07 12:29:34	nadir	huh? at the server it should work, no?
2011-08-07 12:29:43	fsmithred	well, yeah
2011-08-07 12:29:55	fsmithred	you can't get to that page?
2011-08-07 12:29:55	nadir	i made an index.html at /var/www, so i can just type http://resident.dyndns.info
2011-08-07 12:30:02	nadir	and skip the ~molloy
2011-08-07 12:30:04	fsmithred	from the link I posted
2011-08-07 12:30:05	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-07 12:30:17	nadir	yes, i can, sorry. let me stress: i do tests on my PC
2011-08-07 12:30:19	fsmithred	I had to go to molloy and then remove it from the address bar
2011-08-07 12:30:24		[dbb0 back: gone 00:15:20]
2011-08-07 12:31:04	fsmithred	http://resident.dyndns.info/content/misc.html does not work

2011-08-07 12:32:06	fsmithred	links in the start page point to molloy
2011-08-07 12:32:13	nadir	yup
2011-08-07 12:32:31	nadir	yup as far i can yup when it comes to  that...
2011-08-07 12:32:52	dbb0	what did i miss
2011-08-07 12:32:55	fsmithred	if you want it under /var/www, you need to change those links
2011-08-07 12:33:14	nadir	no, i only want pyblosxom
2011-08-07 12:33:24	nadir	wait.
2011-08-07 12:33:29	fsmithred	well, change the appropriate links
2011-08-07 12:33:34	fsmithred	why you want it there?
2011-08-07 12:33:53	nadir	cause i only want to test pyblosxom
2011-08-07 12:34:02	nadir	and it seemed more easy, but in the end it was no

2011-08-07 12:35:41	nadir	i did that from here:

2011-08-07 12:36:05	nadir	a miracle. i am a wizzard.
2011-08-07 12:36:14	fsmithred	huh?

2011-08-07 12:38:23	nadir	yes. i tried this and that. no luck. always ended at resident.
2011-08-07 12:38:31	nadir	than i moved pyblosxom to /var/www...
2011-08-07 12:38:35	nadir	yes
2011-08-07 12:38:38	fsmithred	well, did you edit all the links in your index pages?
2011-08-07 12:38:38	dbb0	what are you trying to do?
2011-08-07 12:38:39	nadir	i got a copy here.
2011-08-07 12:38:54	fsmithred	or do they still point to the dyndns address?
2011-08-07 12:39:00	nadir	let me pastebinit the index page, but all is good.
2011-08-07 12:39:25	nadir	http://paste.debian.net/125374/
2011-08-07 12:39:39	nadir	dbb0, i wanted to test pyblosxom on the PC
2011-08-07 12:39:49	nadir	i got it at my home, public_html
2011-08-07 12:40:01	nadir	it points to my localhost, everywhere, as far i can tell, and all works.
2011-08-07 12:40:24	nadir	i always get to localhost/~me/bookmarks.html and so on
2011-08-07 12:40:34	nadir	but if i click on the blog, i go to the server.
2011-08-07 12:40:35	fsmithred	yeah, but look at the links in the index pages
2011-08-07 12:41:03	dbb0	you shouldn't need the initial .
2011-08-07 12:41:17	nadir	its habit
2011-08-07 12:41:38	dbb0	a "/foo" means doucumentroot/foo, not system root
2011-08-07 12:42:19	dbb0	i think if your server is running windows the dots cause an error
2011-08-07 12:42:51	nadir	what the fucking fuck? now it works?
2011-08-07 12:43:08	nadir	holy shit, i should go out more. I get paranoid.
2011-08-07 12:43:19	nadir	dbb0, but is it bad to use the dot?
2011-08-07 12:43:34	nadir	i want to make the girls horny, i heard they had a spot somewhere....
2011-08-07 12:43:52	nadir	fsmithred, i swear it was that way this morning.
2011-08-07 12:44:01	nadir	and i didn't giv up soon.
2011-08-07 12:44:33	fsmithred	lol
2011-08-07 12:44:41	dbb0	nadir: it's just useless if you're already in the document root
2011-08-07 12:44:51	nadir	ah, ok. useless is fine for me.
2011-08-07 12:45:09	fsmithred	http://www.disabled-world.com/img/sex/g-spot.jpg
2011-08-07 12:45:20	nadir	i seem to remember somewhere in bash i read it is better to use a leading dot. thats where it comes from
2011-08-07 12:45:58	nadir	fsmithred, see, its better to put it in the file. the other one is a bit hard to find.
2011-08-07 12:46:17	fsmithred	huh?
2011-08-07 12:46:24	nadir	the spot.
2011-08-07 12:46:44	nadir	ah, well. sorry. i am to happy that it works now, and am a bit out of my mind.
2011-08-07 12:47:45	fsmithred	I was gonna try to test it from here, but I don't know the lan address of the pc
2011-08-07 12:48:32	nadir	its not forwarded anyway, and i would not know how to deal with two webservers.
2011-08-07 12:48:39	fsmithred	come to think of it, I don't know if you have a browser installed on the server
2011-08-07 12:48:42	nadir	probably via ports, but that is a bit much of confusion for now
2011-08-07 12:48:51	nadir	probably lynx.
2011-08-07 12:48:52	fsmithred	no, I mean through ssh to server
2011-08-07 12:48:59	fsmithred	yeah, that would be my guess
2011-08-07 12:49:12	nadir	but you can ssh via the hostname, or not
2011-08-07 12:49:12	dbb0	on stackoverflow a discussion points out that "./" only works in non-strict doctypes
2011-08-07 12:49:27	nadir	ok, dbb0, thanks. i will get rid of it, and keep it in mind.
2011-08-07 12:50:45	dbb0	i'd recommend using explicit paths starting from /
2011-08-07 12:50:59	dbb0	but it could be more typing
2011-08-07 12:51:28	nadir	-> /long/path/to/wherever/but/always ?
2011-08-07 12:51:34	dbb0	and if it already works don't worry about it
2011-08-07 12:51:53	nadir	i told you its all put together somehow. very ugly.
2011-08-07 12:51:59	fsmithred	wouldn't it start with http:// ?
2011-08-07 12:52:04	dbb0	no
2011-08-07 12:52:07	nadir	i would prefer consistent ways to do it.
2011-08-07 12:52:17	dbb0	that's onle useful for external links
2011-08-07 12:52:21	dbb0	only*
2011-08-07 12:52:37	dbb0	nadir: where is your doc root on the system
2011-08-07 12:52:38	fsmithred	so start with localhost?
2011-08-07 12:52:46	dbb0	fsmithred: no
2011-08-07 12:52:53	fsmithred	ok, I'm confused
2011-08-07 12:53:02	fsmithred	aren't we talking about links?
2011-08-07 12:53:04	dbb0	because then the clients will be directed to THEIR localhost
2011-08-07 12:53:20	fsmithred	yeah, he's on localhost testing
2011-08-07 12:53:25	fsmithred	ok, so hostname/blah
2011-08-07 12:53:39	dbb0	let's say your files are at /home/nadir/www
2011-08-07 12:53:42	nadir	what is doc root?
2011-08-07 12:53:56	dbb0	in this example /home/nadir/www is the document root
2011-08-07 12:54:06	dbb0	the top of the site
2011-08-07 12:54:13	nadir	ok, i got ~/public_html
2011-08-07 12:54:16	nadir	or /var/www
2011-08-07 12:54:37	dbb0	so the path to /home/nadir/www/foo/bar.html would just be "/foo/bar.html"
2011-08-07 12:54:47	fsmithred	yeah, ok
2011-08-07 12:55:29	dbb0	the path "./foo/bar.html" would _only_ work from the top directory
2011-08-07 12:55:48	dbb0	but "/foo/bar.html" would work from anywhere inside www
2011-08-07 12:55:52	fsmithred	cool
2011-08-07 12:55:58	fsmithred	never tried it with a dot
2011-08-07 12:56:06	fsmithred	one thing I have noticed...
2011-08-07 12:56:14	nadir	yes, very cool. i tried all i can think of to solve that.
2011-08-07 12:56:23	nadir	top-dir -> /path/to
2011-08-07 12:56:24	nadir	good
2011-08-07 12:56:24	fsmithred	relative links vs. full links
2011-08-07 12:56:42	fsmithred	if you have a site that requires login, full links will force you to login for every page
2011-08-07 12:57:53	dbb0	probably has something to do with cookies, but i don't know
2011-08-07 12:58:09	fsmithred	discovered that on my genealogy site
2011-08-07 12:58:21	fsmithred	which is just a bunch of html pages linked to each other
2011-08-07 12:59:25	fsmithred	so, when are we going to start learning python?
2011-08-07 12:59:29	fsmithred	(hides)
2011-08-07 12:59:51	dbb0	why do you want to learn python
2011-08-07 13:00:13	fsmithred	for pyblosxom
2011-08-07 13:00:19	nadir	python is the same fuck like perl, in my humble, so for me it would not matter.
2011-08-07 13:00:26	fsmithred	at least enough to figure out how to get the damned plugin to work
2011-08-07 13:00:38	nadir	which is the one you tried?
2011-08-07 13:00:43	fsmithred	index
2011-08-07 13:00:48	fsmithred	hang on, I'll get the link
2011-08-07 13:00:49	nadir	i tried index, big failure. ups, so the same.
2011-08-07 13:00:56	nadir	no, got it already.
2011-08-07 13:00:59	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-07 13:01:06	nadir	put it in /var/www/content/blog/plugins
2011-08-07 13:01:08	nadir	no luck
2011-08-07 13:01:08	fsmithred	some instructions would help
2011-08-07 13:01:12	nadir	yes.
2011-08-07 13:01:24	fsmithred	I put mine in $datadir/plugins
2011-08-07 13:01:33	fsmithred	and it's active
2011-08-07 13:01:39	fsmithred	but it breaks the site
2011-08-07 13:01:48	fsmithred	rename it to index.py_ deactivates it
2011-08-07 13:02:13	dbb0	did you try executing the script from the command line to check for errors
2011-08-07 13:02:21	fsmithred	you're supposed to put some lines that are in the beginning of the file in the config file
2011-08-07 13:02:25	fsmithred	optional configs
2011-08-07 13:02:29	nadir	no errors here. good hint
2011-08-07 13:02:32	fsmithred	and I think you're supposed to edit them
2011-08-07 13:02:44	nadir	the side says all configs are optional
2011-08-07 13:02:59	nadir	http://snarfed.org/pyblosxom_index
2011-08-07 13:03:05	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-07 13:03:22	dbb0	these blog generators just look like more trouble than they're worth
2011-08-07 13:03:43	nadir	lol
2011-08-07 13:03:44	dbb0	you guys could have written your whole website in bits by now
2011-08-07 13:03:55	fsmithred	  File "index.py", line 2
2011-08-07 13:03:55	fsmithred	    http://snarfed.org/space/pyblosxom+index
2011-08-07 13:03:55	fsmithred	        ^
2011-08-07 13:03:55	fsmithred	SyntaxError: invalid syntax
2011-08-07 13:04:27	dbb0	you can't just put a URL in the middle of a python script. i know that much
2011-08-07 13:04:32	nadir	your code starts with """
2011-08-07 13:04:32	fsmithred	comments in python don't require a particular character at the beginning of the line?
2011-08-07 13:04:47	dbb0	yes, they require #
2011-08-07 13:04:48	fsmithred	and no shebang?
2011-08-07 13:05:08	nadir	i think """ works as a comment, and that is what i got at the beginning of it.
2011-08-07 13:05:13	dbb0	fsmithred: if you run "python script.py" you dont need a shebang
2011-08-07 13:05:20	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-07 13:05:24	fsmithred	that's what I did
2011-08-07 13:05:31	dbb0	" is the comment character for vim files
2011-08-07 13:05:33	fsmithred	but I don't know if that's what pyblosxom does
2011-08-07 13:05:44	dbb0	# is for python
2011-08-07 13:06:12	dbb0	as for the URL it will have to be stored as a string of some kind
2011-08-07 13:06:16	nadir	yeah, but like said, mine starts with three quotes, and until the next three quots all is comment.
2011-08-07 13:06:25	dbb0	but i dont know what the variable name is supposed to be
2011-08-07 13:06:57	dbb0	nadir: how do you know that it's treated as a comment
2011-08-07 13:07:21	nadir	via syntax highlighting
2011-08-07 13:07:29	nadir	and from its content too.
2011-08-07 13:07:44	dbb0	ah, you're talking about multiline comments
2011-08-07 13:07:49	nadir	http://paste.debian.net/125378/
2011-08-07 13:08:02	dbb0	nadir: syntax highlighting doesn't mean jack
2011-08-07 13:08:25	fsmithred	oh, I didn't get the three quotes on the first line
2011-08-07 13:08:30	fsmithred	mine starts with index.py
2011-08-07 13:08:34	dbb0	# is for single-line comments, and the triple-double-quote is for multiline comments
2011-08-07 13:10:34	fsmithred	oh, cool
2011-08-07 13:10:45	fsmithred	I added the first quotes, and now it doesn't break the blog
2011-08-07 13:10:47	dbb0	is this it: http://snarfed.org/index.py
2011-08-07 13:10:54	nadir	yes
2011-08-07 13:10:54	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-07 13:11:42	dbb0	fsmithred: so know you see why python gave the syntax errors
2011-08-07 13:11:57	fsmithred	yeah, the comments weren't commented out
2011-08-07 13:12:30	fsmithred	still can't see the index it's supposed to create
2011-08-07 13:12:35	fsmithred	just see my blog
2011-08-07 13:12:39	dbb0	which version of python does pyblosxom use
2011-08-07 13:13:40	fsmithred	not specified in pyblosxom.cgi
2011-08-07 13:13:46	fsmithred	and it was installed from debian repo
2011-08-07 13:13:55	fsmithred	so, whatever squeeze has, I guess
2011-08-07 13:14:09	dbb0	http://docs.python.org/tutorial/
2011-08-07 13:14:26	dbb0	that will be enough to get you familiar with python syntax
2011-08-07 13:14:41	dbb0	you can actually do a lot with what's there
2011-08-07 13:14:45	dbb0	similar to the perlintro
2011-08-07 13:14:45	fsmithred	yeah, thanks
2011-08-07 13:15:01	fsmithred	I really want to read a few sentences that tell me how to use this plugin
2011-08-07 13:15:21	fsmithred	don't think I'm capable of writing a nice email to the author right now
2011-08-07 13:16:17	nadir	lol
2011-08-07 13:16:31	nadir	you fucker, where is the docu?
2011-08-07 13:17:02	dbb0	did you set those variables mentioned in the comment block
2011-08-07 13:17:04	fsmithred	a little more eloquent than that
2011-08-07 13:17:10	fsmithred	set them to what?
2011-08-07 13:17:17	dbb0	whatever you need
2011-08-07 13:17:22	dbb0	like site-index
2011-08-07 13:17:32	fsmithred	yeah, I tried
2011-08-07 13:17:32	dbb0	you definitely need that
2011-08-07 13:17:37	fsmithred	but I don't really know what to put there
2011-08-07 13:17:45	fsmithred	I tried the full url to my blog
2011-08-07 13:17:49	dbb0	nope
2011-08-07 13:17:51	fsmithred	I tried parts of it
2011-08-07 13:18:09	fsmithred	I tried surfing to my-url/site-index
2011-08-07 13:18:13	fsmithred	index
2011-08-07 13:18:14	dbb0	did you try /home/whatever/www
2011-08-07 13:18:14	fsmithred	index.py
2011-08-07 13:18:17	fsmithred	just guessing
2011-08-07 13:18:25	fsmithred	an example would be helpful
2011-08-07 13:18:53	fsmithred	normally, I go to my-url/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi
2011-08-07 13:18:54	dbb0	since it's reading files instead of webpages it should be the actual path of the files
2011-08-07 13:18:55	fsmithred	and I see my blog
2011-08-07 13:19:02	fsmithred	aha!
2011-08-07 13:19:04	fsmithred	thanks
2011-08-07 13:19:07	fsmithred	I'll try that
2011-08-07 13:19:37	dbb0	it's either that or /
2011-08-07 13:20:36	fsmithred	path to the cgi file, or path to the plugin file?
2011-08-07 13:21:00	dbb0	whereever the top of the blog is
2011-08-07 13:21:07	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-07 13:21:27	dbb0	maybe /cgi-bin from your example
2011-08-07 13:22:28	fsmithred	tried all three, no good
2011-08-07 13:22:43	fsmithred	full path to cgi file, / and path from /cgi-bin
2011-08-07 13:23:00	nadir	same here
2011-08-07 13:23:09	dbb0	what were the values literally
2011-08-07 13:23:45	nadir	http://localhost/cgi-bin/index.py
2011-08-07 13:23:54	fsmithred	first:   /home/fred/public_html/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi
2011-08-07 13:23:57	nadir	http://localhost/content/blog/plugins/index.py
2011-08-07 13:24:08	fsmithred	I tried url last night and it didn't work
2011-08-07 13:24:30	dbb0	did you quote it
2011-08-07 13:24:57	dbb0	because it's a string.
2011-08-07 13:24:58	fsmithred	I put it between the existing quotes
2011-08-07 13:25:02	dbb0	ok
2011-08-07 13:25:03	fsmithred	copied and pasted
2011-08-07 13:25:05	fsmithred	then edited
2011-08-07 13:25:15	dbb0	and it's not commented out
2011-08-07 13:26:06	fsmithred	nope
2011-08-07 13:26:18	fsmithred	just copied those five lines and put them at the end of the config file
2011-08-07 13:29:34	dbb0	put them at the beginning
2011-08-07 13:29:47	dbb0	before the line   trigger = config.get('index_trigger', 'site-index')
2011-08-07 13:30:05	dbb0	after __description__
2011-08-07 13:30:35	dbb0	i'm not sure how the python interpreter compiles scripts
2011-08-07 13:30:48	dbb0	maybe the vars have to be set before anything uses them
2011-08-07 13:30:57	fsmithred	I'm gonna put them in the Optional Config section
2011-08-07 13:31:20	fsmithred	cool, now I got an internal server error
2011-08-07 13:32:20	fsmithred	oh, maybe it needs to be after the plugin configuration
2011-08-07 13:33:01	dbb0	in config.py?
2011-08-07 13:33:06	fsmithred	yeah
2011-08-07 13:33:36	dbb0	this just furthers my pain-in-the-ass theory about blog generators
2011-08-07 13:33:42	fsmithred	lol
2011-08-07 13:34:14	dbb0	have you tried blogger (really)
2011-08-07 13:34:36	fsmithred	oh, the server error was because I dropped the closing quote
2011-08-07 13:34:46	fsmithred	nope, haven't tried it
2011-08-07 13:34:50	fsmithred	what is it?
2011-08-07 13:35:36	dbb0	free blog site, like wordpress
2011-08-07 13:35:39	dbb0	blogger.com
2011-08-07 13:37:14	dbb0	i use one to store snippets of code and such that i lose/cant remember

2011-08-07 13:37:36	dbb0	http://debiandan.blogspot.com
2011-08-07 13:40:58	fsmithred	well, that's up to nadir
2011-08-07 13:41:12	fsmithred	I don't really care to have a blog; I'm just playing/testing
2011-08-07 13:41:16	nadir	no thanks.
2011-08-07 13:41:20	fsmithred	one question...
2011-08-07 13:41:27	fsmithred	what's in it for Dan?
2011-08-07 13:41:28	nadir	but it looks good.
2011-08-07 13:42:05	fsmithred	yeah, it does
2011-08-07 13:42:24	dbb0	?
2011-08-07 13:43:19	fsmithred	I guess my question is, who pays for the server space?
2011-08-07 13:43:24	nadir	the theme looks good.
2011-08-07 13:43:29	fsmithred	Are you forced to look at advertisements?
2011-08-07 13:43:32	nadir	the ones who keep the data
2011-08-07 13:43:38	fsmithred	I see "powered by Google"
2011-08-07 13:43:39	fsmithred	now
2011-08-07 13:43:43	dbb0	blogger's free
2011-08-07 13:43:56	dbb0	you can put AdSense on it and make money
2011-08-07 13:44:13	dbb0	you get like $0.08 every time somebody clicks on an ad
2011-08-07 13:44:28	dbb0	i think i made $10 one year from a blog
2011-08-07 13:44:33	nadir	that should keep me busy.
2011-08-07 13:44:52	nadir	(calculates the price of a new mouse...)
2011-08-07 13:44:56	fsmithred	lol
2011-08-07 13:45:14	fsmithred	you might need to use a proxy server for that
2011-08-07 13:45:22	nadir	i think for having a look pyblosxom and such is ok
2011-08-07 13:45:44	nadir	i did never do any cgi, so its kind of an experience.
2011-08-07 13:45:57	nadir	whatever it might be, but i like it.
2011-08-07 13:46:27	fsmithred	dbb0, how do you make posts on this site?
2011-08-07 13:46:37	nadir	do you know that you now (?) have to tell google your mobile number or real number to get an account?
2011-08-07 13:46:42	fsmithred	edit window in a web browser, like a forum?
2011-08-07 13:46:55	dbb0	fsmithred: yeah
2011-08-07 13:47:02	fsmithred	isn't that just for google+?
2011-08-07 13:47:18	nadir	here, Germany, its for stock google. but not for long,
2011-08-07 13:47:35	fsmithred	fuck that
2011-08-07 13:47:43	nadir	and if i use tor, i got to tell the city i usually post from
2011-08-07 13:47:46	nadir	and so on.
2011-08-07 13:47:57	nadir	it is security, i assume, but its also a bit strange.
2011-08-07 13:48:06	fsmithred	security for whom?
2011-08-07 13:48:18	fsmithred	anonymity is my security
2011-08-07 13:48:18	nadir	so no one cracked your account.
2011-08-07 13:48:22	nadir	i guess, no idea.
2011-08-07 13:48:48	fsmithred	well, most of the security measures I've seen make it easier for someone to crack my account
2011-08-07 13:48:54	nadir	the web-sites of google suck, as far its me, but that blogger blog looks cool
2011-08-07 13:48:55	fsmithred	fucking "secret" questions
2011-08-07 13:49:14	nadir	"is your left ball as big as your right one?"
2011-08-07 13:49:19	fsmithred	db, you picked your own page layout and colors?
2011-08-07 13:49:24	fsmithred	bigger
2011-08-07 13:49:28	fsmithred	now it's not a secret
2011-08-07 13:49:36	fsmithred	but...
2011-08-07 13:49:40	dbb0	fsmithred: i started with a theme template and customized the css a little bit
2011-08-07 13:49:54	dbb0	you can make your own stylesheet of you want
2011-08-07 13:50:32	fsmithred	yeah, but we don't want google to have our plans to take over the world on their server
2011-08-07 13:51:36	nadir	i know so little that it probably doesn't matter much what i do or don't do. Still i prefer to avoid
2011-08-07 13:51:41	dbb0	there's also livejournal, from the good-old-days
2011-08-07 13:52:07	dbb0	it's pretty private i guess
2011-08-07 13:53:03	dbb0	wordpress, also nongoogle
2011-08-07 13:53:25	fsmithred	brb - gotta let the coffee out
2011-08-07 13:54:15	nadir	livejournal has decided that i speak Russian, but it looks cool
2011-08-07 13:54:57	nadir	by my paranoia i ran into having ten email-accounts and such...
2011-08-07 13:54:59	nadir	not so funny.
2011-08-07 13:55:07	fsmithred	b
2011-08-07 13:55:40	nadir	otoh i needed google for doc, arcor for newsgroups, one for mail, and so son.
2011-08-07 13:56:23	fsmithred	I think I have five email accounts now
2011-08-07 13:56:30	fsmithred	well, six
2011-08-07 13:56:37	nadir	very confusing, no?
2011-08-07 13:56:42	dbb0	i've been using hushmail/9y. you can actually encrypt messages
2011-08-07 13:56:42	fsmithred	well, seven
2011-08-07 13:56:50	fsmithred	but seventh never gets used
2011-08-07 13:56:55	fsmithred	and nobody knows about it
2011-08-07 13:57:05	fsmithred	sixth gets forwarded to another one
2011-08-07 13:57:30	fsmithred	and google already has my phone number, whether they know it or not
2011-08-07 14:13:30	fsmithred	oh, I just saw what you wrote - you can encrypt gmail, too. Just have to use a mail client
2011-08-07 14:13:43	nadir	ah.
2011-08-07 14:14:06	nadir	encryption email is with gnupg, or does it work with other tools too?
2011-08-07 14:14:07	fsmithred	never tried it with the imap account, but other accounts are pop
2011-08-07 14:14:12	fsmithred	gpg
2011-08-07 14:14:27	fsmithred	that's all I've ever used
2011-08-07 14:14:32	fsmithred	in icedove
2011-08-07 14:14:32	nadir	i got it on my list.
2011-08-07 14:14:46	nadir	its like ssh, keys, and such. all very difficult.
2011-08-07 14:14:59	nadir	at first glance i think: wtf?
2011-08-07 14:15:10	fsmithred	yeah, it's a little confusing
2011-08-07 14:15:14	nadir	after the third read it gets a bit clearer.
2011-08-07 14:15:23	nadir	and as i barely use email anyway...
2011-08-07 14:15:27	fsmithred	but if you install enigmail, it's pretty easy to use in icedove
2011-08-07 14:15:39	nadir	enigmail? never heard that.
2011-08-07 14:15:53	fsmithred	gpg plugin for icedove/thunderbird
2011-08-07 14:15:55	nadir	ah, ok, found it.
2011-08-07 14:16:10	fsmithred	install it, and you get an extra button in icedove
2011-08-07 14:16:28	nadir	uhum.
2011-08-07 14:16:29	fsmithred	it'll show you your key, who signed your key
2011-08-07 14:16:31	fsmithred	etc
2011-08-07 14:16:46	nadir	but i first create a key, and i have to put it online, right?
2011-08-07 14:16:54	nadir	that is the way it works?
2011-08-07 14:16:59	fsmithred	yeah, you create a public/private key pair
2011-08-07 14:17:07	fsmithred	public key goes to a keyserver
2011-08-07 14:17:18	fsmithred	you have to send it
2011-08-07 14:17:22	nadir	keyserver, i forgot the word.
2011-08-07 14:17:29	fsmithred	then you can get other people to sign your key
2011-08-07 14:17:37	nadir	ok, so another question.
2011-08-07 14:17:39	fsmithred	see if local LUG has a key-signing party
2011-08-07 14:17:48	fsmithred	bring two forms of identification
2011-08-07 14:17:49	nadir	seahorse, is it only for gpg?
2011-08-07 14:17:56	fsmithred	passport is good choice for one of them
2011-08-07 14:18:03	fsmithred	don't know it
2011-08-07 14:18:06	nadir	without signing party i am doomed?
2011-08-07 14:18:14	fsmithred	not necessarily
2011-08-07 14:18:19	nadir	i am not that keen on a party.
2011-08-07 14:18:23	fsmithred	but you'll have to know at least one other geek
2011-08-07 14:18:27	nadir	ah.
2011-08-07 14:18:29	nadir	ok
2011-08-07 14:18:30	fsmithred	who has a key
2011-08-07 14:18:35	fsmithred	and knows you
2011-08-07 14:18:50	nadir	face-to-face?
2011-08-07 14:18:52	fsmithred	it'll work without anyone else signing it
2011-08-07 14:19:04	fsmithred	yeah, face-to-face is best
2011-08-07 14:19:06	nadir	it will? or it will not?
2011-08-07 14:19:11	fsmithred	yes, it'll work
2011-08-07 14:19:15	nadir	mhh... that is a bit of a problem.
2011-08-07 14:19:21	fsmithred	all the signatures do is build up a web of trust
2011-08-07 14:19:36	fsmithred	anyone can have a key and sign their emails
2011-08-07 14:19:51	fsmithred	but you still don't know if they're really who they say they are
2011-08-07 14:20:06	fsmithred	if there are other people willing to verify the identity
2011-08-07 14:20:15	fsmithred	even if you don't know those other people
2011-08-07 14:20:19	nadir	wait, i think here is a ChaosComputerClub, or a BSD-club or such.
2011-08-07 14:20:22	fsmithred	you can see who verified them
2011-08-07 14:20:27	fsmithred	and follow the web of trust
2011-08-07 14:20:30	nadir	still not very keen to get in touch, but at  least a choice
2011-08-07 14:20:40	fsmithred	eventually, you might find someone you can really believe
2011-08-07 14:20:57	dbb0	google's public dns is actually better than either of my ISPs'
2011-08-07 14:21:07	fsmithred	same here, dbb
2011-08-07 14:21:17	fsmithred	I moved here in june
2011-08-07 14:21:26	fsmithred	there's a 20GB cable connection
2011-08-07 14:21:38	fsmithred	surfing was slower than on my 1.5GB dsl
2011-08-07 14:21:44	fsmithred	Gb, not GB
2011-08-07 14:21:46	fsmithred	geez
2011-08-07 14:21:59	fsmithred	so I changed to 8.8.8.8
2011-08-07 14:22:08	fsmithred	and surfing got faster immediately
2011-08-07 14:22:17	dbb0	well i mean that it doesn't put ads on non-existen pages
2011-08-07 14:22:24	fsmithred	oh that, too
2011-08-07 14:22:26	fsmithred	I hate that
2011-08-07 14:22:39	dbb0	so does "open"dns
2011-08-07 14:22:41	fsmithred	gimme a goddamn error if I got nowhere
2011-08-07 14:23:42	dbb0	srsly
2011-08-07 14:25:20	fsmithred	If I knew an easy way to get the numeric address, I'd use that for my bookmarks
2011-08-07 14:25:57	dbb0	ping
2011-08-07 14:26:46	nadir	there is also an addon, or several, for iceweasel
2011-08-07 14:26:48	fsmithred	nah, that doesn't work
2011-08-07 14:26:54	nadir	huh?
2011-08-07 14:27:02	fsmithred	just gives me the address of the host
2011-08-07 14:27:14	fsmithred	addon sounds possible
2011-08-07 14:27:19	nadir	# ping google.de
2011-08-07 14:27:19	nadir	PING google.de (209.85.149.99) 56(84) bytes of data.
2011-08-07 14:27:30	nadir	else nmap
2011-08-07 14:27:38	fsmithred	um
2011-08-07 14:27:48	fsmithred	not supposed to do port scans without permission
2011-08-07 14:27:54	nadir	nope, i think that was wrong, or at least more difficult.
2011-08-07 14:27:56	fsmithred	might even be illegal
2011-08-07 14:28:03	nadir	let me search to find the addon i use
2011-08-07 14:28:41	nadir	there is a scan for nmap which only scans if the host is up and all.
2011-08-07 14:28:57	nadir	so one does _not_ scan the wrong network per (bad) luck.
2011-08-07 14:29:37	nadir	http://code.google.com/p/firefox-showip/
2011-08-07 14:29:49	nadir	google is everywhere....
2011-08-07 14:30:25	dbb0	fsmithred: so http://{IP address}/dir/page.html
2011-08-07 14:37:06	fsmithred	well, I added Search IP with honey and utrace plugin
2011-08-07 14:37:16	fsmithred	but I can't find how to make it work
2011-08-07 14:37:18	fsmithred	no icon
2011-08-07 14:37:25	fsmithred	can't find it in menu
2011-08-07 14:37:46	fsmithred	the preferences button is grayed out
2011-08-07 14:39:32	nadir	i will eat and such.
2011-08-07 14:41:20	fsmithred	ok
2011-08-07 14:41:32	fsmithred	I should probably do that, too
2011-08-07 14:41:47	nadir	yeah. have fun. later.
2011-08-07 14:41:51	fsmithred	see ya

2011-08-08 10:49:09	dbb0	last night when i was trying to fall asleep i had some ideas about what to add to it and now i can't remember
2011-08-08 10:51:15	nadir	yup, i know that problem.
2011-08-08 10:51:44	nadir	though for me its also often that in bed it seems nice and easy, once i try all falls in pieces.
2011-08-08 10:52:07	dbb0	oh yeah
2011-08-08 10:52:19	dbb0	i know that game
2011-08-08 10:52:45	nadir	was it logistics or was it look&feel?
2011-08-08 10:54:53	dbb0	there's not much look
2011-08-08 10:55:03	dbb0	i guess perltidy takes care of it anyway
2011-08-08 10:56:34	dbb0	part of what i wanted to do was try rewriting it using objects
2011-08-08 10:57:09	dbb0	e.g., "body" and "head" could be objects of the class Section
2011-08-08 11:37:32	⇦	nadir (~markus@g230212006.adsl.alicedsl.de) has quit (Quit: life sucks:-))
