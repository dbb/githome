2010-05-07 10:05:42	saimon	Hi all...[vim newbie] Recently while using vim in the osx terminal, yanking to the * (or +) registers doesn't copy stuff to the system clipboard any longer. The text is inside the register but not in the system clipboard. I have vim compiled with +xterm_clipboard (In fact previously it did used to work though occasionally would fail). Now hovewever I can never get it to work. Any ideas? (Yes I know I can use macvim but I prefer to use the term
2010-05-07 10:06:00	SuperFlo	saimon: using Terminal.app ?
2010-05-07 10:06:08	saimon	SuperFlo: yes
2010-05-07 10:06:21	SuperFlo	saimon: Terminal.app isn't X.
2010-05-07 10:06:35	graywh	have you tried using macvim in the terminal?
2010-05-07 10:06:38	SuperFlo	I have a workaround for you though.
2010-05-07 10:07:08	SuperFlo	specially for osx, and vim inside Terminal.app ->
2010-05-07 10:07:13	SuperFlo	nmap <C-p> :set paste<CR>:r !pbpaste<CR>:set nopaste<CR>
2010-05-07 10:07:13	SuperFlo	imap <C-p> <Esc>:set paste<CR>:r !pbpaste<CR>:set nopaste<CR>

2010-05-07 10:08:38	saimon	SuperFlo: what's that doing exactly? mapping pbpaste on C-p ? i.e. allowing pasting from system clipboard  into vim?
2010-05-07 10:08:47	SuperFlo	saimon: yes
2010-05-07 10:08:49	SuperFlo	graywh: right ...
2010-05-07 10:09:02	SuperFlo	I yank inside system clipboard using apple+C :\
2010-05-07 10:09:12	graywh	also, that workaround is line-wise-only
2010-05-07 10:09:12	SuperFlo	but there's also pbcopy
2010-05-07 10:09:13	saimon	SuperFlo: thanks..However my more immediate concern is getting stuff from vim out into the clipboard
2010-05-07 10:09:26	SuperFlo	pbcopy would be the solution I guess
2010-05-07 10:09:27	saimon	SuperFlo: ah yes that's more intersting
2010-05-07 10:09:58	engla	just for curiousity, macvim includes functionality to connect + or * to the OS X clipboard?

2010-05-07 11:00:15	vimgor	Cream is a fork of the vim project that tries to make vim simpler to use by hiding its modality. It is off topic here, as it's sufficiently different from vanilla vim that our gurus aren't likely to be able to help much with it. http://cream.sf.net (See also win32-patched)

This can be used to get a recent vim patchlevel on win32 without needing to compile vim yourself. http://cream.sf.net/download.html

2010-05-07 21:15:47	dahu	sure... those memories are a bit rusty, but I remember the basic mechanics. Besides, I can look it up to get a refresher.

2010-05-08 00:17:27	dpyro	well, what do you recommend mapwise?

2010-05-08 00:24:29	godlygeek	that's not the point - the point is that the sort of people who make a whole lot of maps to make vim work "better" usually wind up never learning vim, just their editor that they wrote themselves on top of vim using custom mappings everywhere.  and that homegrown editor is usually a lot worse than vim.

2010-05-08 00:43:59	synfinatic	dpyro: so i'm no expert, but i did it the other way.  map the arrows to move between splits and use hjkl to move in a buffer.  no ctrl-w (which I find awkward on a laptop keyboard) and hjkl is used for the more common action of moving around in a buffer
2010-05-08 00:45:34	dpyro	synfinatic: i might try that :)

2010-05-08 01:53:20	dahu	so, features you will want to learn quickly: search & replace; moving around outside of edit mode
2010-05-08 01:53:44	dahu	I still use the arrow keys, and I've been vimming since '94
2010-05-08 01:53:54	dahu	hehe... that'll draw some flack, I'm sure
2010-05-08 01:54:12	cvk	dahu: Thanks! That is really encouraging

2010-05-08 01:56:16	tmr	Nothing wrong in using arrows, it's just usually slower.

2010-05-08 05:05:44	kadee	OK, let's make the problem more simple, and prepand the missing zero first. %s/\(\d)\(:\d\d)\(:\d\d\)/\=(submatch(1) < 12 ? '0' : submatch(1).submatch(2)).submatch(3)/ for all time stamps of the form 1:23:33 AM. Is that right?
2010-05-08 05:06:21	dahu	yes
2010-05-08 05:06:31	dahu	the first sub does your first requirement

2010-05-08 05:14:27	kadee	It's not necessary, we only need an extra space usually it's before the terminating forward slash
2010-05-08 05:15:31	shomon	another question - I've been doing quite big substitutions, so always using arrow keys to go back and forth on the vim command line: is there an equivalent of ctrl-A to jump to the beginning or end of these lines?

2010-06-14 06:00:01	grumpus	Hello, I'm switching over from TextMate to Vim, but there are a few things I'm used to, which I can't find... One thing is context-sensitive line commenting. In Textmate, when I hit cmd-/ I comment out a line or selected block using the appropriate line-commenting style (// for JavaScript, # for Python, --- for SQL, {# ... #} for a Django template HTML file, etc...). Is there a command or plugin for Vim, which does this?

2011-07-19 21:11:40	kwtm	Am reading up on spellchecking feature of vim, but would like some advice.  I actually don't need spellchecking, but have a list of common technical terms in my "word completion list" and I'd like to easily add "the word under the cursor" to that file.  I wanted to use the  zg  command but I need to turn on spelling check for that.
2011-07-19 21:12:12	MarcWeber	kwtm: what do you mean by "add word to the file"?
2011-07-19 21:12:22	kwtm	Does the word completion feature use the spelling words files?  And if so, is use of the spellcheck commands like    zg   the proper way  add a word to the file?

2011-07-19 21:12:53	kwtm	MarcWeber-  By that, I mean that I might type a term, like   indome  but Ctrl-N fails to find   "indomethacin"   as the correct completion for that word.
2011-07-19 21:13:06	MarcWeber	kwtm: open the file which contains the words. Then it does work.
2011-07-19 21:13:16	MarcWeber	or create a tag file and make that contain the words. then it works as well.
2011-07-19 21:13:24	kwtm	MarcWeber-  So, I will type in the complete word, and I'd like to type   zg   or some similar command and have that word added to the file which contains the words.
2011-07-19 21:13:29	MarcWeber	Or create a custom completion function

2011-07-19 21:14:03	kwtm	??  Not sure if you understand my meaning, MarcWeber.  I know that adding the word to the file will work.  I want an easy way to add the word to the file.
2011-07-19 21:14:22	MarcWeber	kwtm: you can add words in different ways.
2011-07-19 21:14:37	kwtm	MarcWeber-  It looks like the command    zg   is a way to add a word, but I'm wondering if there is an easier way.
2011-07-19 21:14:45	MarcWeber	you can write word1, word2, word3, you can use [word1, word2] you can use (word word2) you can use word\nword2 where \n is a newline..
2011-07-19 21:15:09	MarcWeber	kwtm: Your task can be scripted in one line. If you don't want to bother with spell checking then don't.

2011-07-19 21:17:01	MarcWeber	dbb0: What about spaces?
2011-07-19 21:17:15	MarcWeber	kwtm: just copy paste a file containing 3 words to dpaste.com
2011-07-19 21:17:22	dbb0	MarcWeber: they don't matter
2011-07-19 21:18:03	dbb0	the file becomes a perl hash, hence the => notation in comments

2011-07-19 21:39:48	MarcWeber	Chibby_: if you use map the rhs (right hand side) of a mapping is mapped to something different again
2011-07-19 21:39:54	MarcWeber	this never happens when using the nore versions of map.

2011-08-06 12:31:04	rane_	I used textmate for years before vim
2011-08-06 12:31:07	zastaph	I'd be perfectly fine with mapping shift+i to i and live with that, and k is just help anyways

2011-08-06 12:33:58	rippa	you mean 10 minutes?

2011-08-06 12:35:04	rippa	I just don't see how what arrow keys have to do with it
2011-08-06 12:35:07	alansaul	zastaph: Your brain isnt thinking when your pressing the arrow keys is it?
2011-08-06 12:35:08	zastaph	alansaul, we are talking swapping j and k then i and k .. it's 1 key difference. i agree that arrow keys is slower
2011-08-06 12:35:27	zastaph	why do you still think im talking about arrow keys?

2011-08-06 12:35:49	rane_	seriously, if instead of having this conversation you were practicing your muscle memory to hjkl you'd already be there
2011-08-06 12:35:50	rippa	hikl looks dumb
2011-08-06 12:35:55	rippa	why not jkli
2011-08-06 12:36:10	zastaph	because my right hand rests on hjkl
2011-08-06 12:36:20	zastaph	hence hjkl is for movement.. but moving my ring finger from k to i is a minor thing
2011-08-06 12:36:23	zastaph	but for my brain its major
2011-08-06 12:36:32	alansaul	zastaph: Its not.

2011-08-06 12:41:29	rane_	efficiency is what's important, if hikl makes you more efficient than hjkl *in the long run* then go for it. still i believe it's just matter of building the muscle memory for hjkl which doesn't take a long time
2011-08-06 12:41:37	imc	i want to get rid of this bad habit!
2011-08-06 12:42:10	alansaul	Don't most people here touch type?

2011-08-06 12:42:35	OODavo	j and k are used far more often than h and l, so generally it'lll be more efficient to have them both home-row.
