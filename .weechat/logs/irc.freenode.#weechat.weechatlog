2010-04-24 12:43:41	dbbolton	where can i find examples of what can be added to the [filter] section of weechat.conf?
2010-04-24 12:43:56	@FlashCode	dbbolton: /help filter
2010-04-24 12:44:08	@FlashCode	you should add with /filter, not in file
2010-04-24 12:45:06	dbbolton	but wouldn't i have to run the command every time i start weechat?
2010-04-24 12:45:28	@FlashCode	no, it's saved in weechat.conf
2010-04-24 12:45:38	@FlashCode	you can force saving with /save (or it's saved when exiting weechat)
2010-04-24 12:45:54	@FlashCode	almost everything is saved in config files
2010-04-24 12:46:52	dbbolton	i used the example /filter command to filter jon/part/quit notifications as given in the user guide, but i don't see where it has been saved in the config file
2010-04-24 12:47:05	dbbolton	i grepped it for 'filter'
2010-04-24 12:49:06	dbbolton	i also looked for 'join' and 'quit'
2010-04-24 12:50:57	dbbolton	i guess /save did it. thanks

2010-04-24 13:05:31	shariebeth	hi, I am running into problems getting the beep.pl script to work. I am running on arch, but had it working with Puppy. I have searched the manual, searched google, my sound works except for this. Alsamixer settings *seem* correct to my inexperienced eye, at least nothing different than before.

2010-04-24 13:06:25	@FlashCode	shariebeth: it makes a system beep
2010-04-24 13:06:29	@FlashCode	not a sound on soundcard
2010-04-24 13:07:06	shariebeth	ok, i get a system beep for other things so I know that works, I feel like I'm missing something obvious
2010-04-24 13:11:09	MrElendig	shariebeth: pcspkr module?
2010-04-24 13:12:54	shariebeth	where would I find that?

2010-05-12 16:43:02	dinosys	but far from complete

2010-05-12 16:51:01	drubin	Emralegna: It requires you to know what number buffers are.  =p
2010-05-12 16:52:08	Emralegna	true... in my case, I know the placement of buffers, so I just read the associated number next to it :p°
