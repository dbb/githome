X starts, but on the working on Xorg.0.log has XINPUT: output, while the non-working one doesn't.  What might possibly cause the non-working one to not do whatever it needs with xinput.

2010-05-21 21:59:01	k4jcw	Hello
2010-05-21 21:59:05	ananth123	must be a busy day with their regular work
2010-05-21 21:59:54	ananth123	i was just wondering if there are any books to learn about low level x programming
2010-05-21 22:00:07	ananth123	xlib or related
2010-05-21 22:00:37	k4jcw	A bunch of years ago there used to be a 5 volume set, back before PDF's.  These days, I have no idea what exists.
2010-05-21 22:01:02	ananth123	oh ok
2010-05-21 22:01:03	k4jcw	But usually you can find plenty of "hello,world" type examples.
2010-05-21 22:01:36	k4jcw	http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib-tutorial/2nd-program-anatomy.html
2010-05-21 22:01:48	ananth123	yes found a few hello world programs on google
2010-05-21 22:01:56	ananth123	but looking for some more theory to go with those
2010-05-21 22:02:06	ananth123	and slightly more complex than that

2010-05-21 22:02:41	ananth123	thanks for the link!
2010-05-21 22:02:43	k4jcw	I usually end up browsing the manuals and checking out various calls to see what they do.  Or find a moderately simple program (source for Xclock, maybe?) and dissect it.
2010-05-21 22:02:43	ananth123	:)
2010-05-21 22:03:11	ananth123	thats an option too!
2010-05-21 22:03:36	ananth123	what program are you working on ? just curious
2010-05-21 22:04:08	k4jcw	Nothing x related.  I mostly do embedded controller work.  But I had a question I was hoping to get answered here.  So far, no luck.
2010-05-21 22:04:57	ananth123	and your question is ?
2010-05-21 22:05:45	k4jcw	I can't seem to get the keyboard and mouse working on one particular machine, which is configured very similarly to another machine.  Thought someone here might have some insight.
2010-05-21 22:06:16	ananth123	usb ?
2010-05-21 22:06:56	ananth123	do these keyb/mouse work on another machine ?
2010-05-21 22:09:38	k4jcw	They work in the machine they're on, in console mode.  It's once you start X they go away.
2010-05-21 22:11:04	ananth123	any errors in the log file ? or startup messages ?
2010-05-21 22:11:48	k4jcw	Nope.
2010-05-21 22:12:43	ananth123	what do you have in your xorg.conf InputDevice section ?
2010-05-21 22:13:56	ananth123	or can you paste the xorg.conf file somewhere where i can see it ?
2010-05-21 22:14:50	Triskelios	seeing /var/log/Xorg.0.log would also be helpful
2010-05-21 22:34:45	k4jcw	I have a suspiction that the problem is I'm running udev-146-r3, because anything later is broken on the AMD architecture until glibc-2.12+ is released.
2010-05-21 22:38:19	ananth123	perhaps you can try with knoppix or a live cd
2010-05-21 22:40:57	k4jcw	http://tinymicros.com/xorg has the log file.  I'll upload the xorg.conf in a second.
2010-05-21 22:42:34	k4jcw	If you look at the end of the .working log, you'll see that it's doing something with config/udev.  That doesn't happen in the non-working log.
2010-05-21 22:43:01	k4jcw	And at this point, the only difference I really see is that one machine is running udev-154 (the working one), and the other is running udev-146-r3

2010-05-21 23:00:37	Triskelios	k4jcw: yeah, there's no hotplug info from udev in the non-working log
2010-05-21 23:01:00	Triskelios	k4jcw: also your InputDevice sections don't work in either case, so you might as well remove them
2010-05-21 23:01:26	k4jcw	Redundant?
2010-05-21 23:02:12	k4jcw	I do have hotplug installed on the machine that's NOT working.
2010-05-21 23:02:34	k4jcw	ANd it's running
2010-05-21 23:04:31	Triskelios	that's probably something different from what I meant..

2010-05-21 23:38:16	dark	Triskelios, yeah, it's intel, thanks. It's weird it's so slow, since gma is somewhat 'advanced' (has opengl and other stuf). on the other hand, the bios reports 8mb of video memory, and gives no option for regular memory being added to it
2010-05-21 23:38:21	dark	maybe i'm expecting too much?
2010-05-21 23:40:06	dark	In order to have kms smooth switching (ctrl+alt+fN from console to x going fast), do I have to turn on frame buffer on console?

2010-05-21 23:47:06	dark	oh, i thought kms were a linux-specific thing
2010-05-21 23:48:39	Triskelios	it was, until the intel driver started ripping out the parts that were moved to the kernel in KMS, so everyone is following suit

2010-05-21 23:52:31	dark	in which distro / operating system
2010-05-21 23:52:42	k4jcw	Gentoo
2010-05-21 23:52:45	dark	oh
2010-05-21 23:53:03	Triskelios	the DejaVu fonts are commonly used and considered decent
2010-05-21 23:53:20	dark	i suppose it doesn't come much pre-configured
2010-05-21 23:53:29	dark	yes, i'm using dejavu right now
2010-05-21 23:54:50	dark	hmm, but the default "sans" font here looks a bit different than dejavu sans
2010-05-21 23:59:56	k4jcw	It appears that I have about 10 fonts installed.  incloding font-adobe-75dpi, corefonts, dejavu, and urw-fonts.  Should I dump all those except dejavu?
2010-05-22 00:02:36	dark	no, not all fonts provide all scripts
2010-05-22 00:03:03	dark	if you are showing a text that is written in an unsupported script in the current font, it will usually default to another script
2010-05-22 00:03:26	dark	it might look odd, but it's better than showing the boxes with hexadecimals
2010-05-22 00:03:43	dark	default to another font*
2010-05-22 00:04:39	dark	also, some documents might require a font to be displayed properly (hmm, pdfs usually come with embedded fonts, at least)
2010-05-22 00:10:15	k4jcw	I can't seem to get past that the fonts look "muddy" on both my Gentoo boxes, and are so crisp and clean on the Windows box.  I'll have to play around, although I think I've messed with the sub-pixel hinting, but not seen much effect.  I'm running the same resolution on all three machines, and one of the Gentoo machines and the Windows box are the same model hardware, LCD, and use DVI connections.  So it's an apples to apples compar
2010-05-22 00:10:15	k4jcw	ison on that basis.
2010-05-22 00:11:41	Triskelios	there are also hinting options to consider. there is patented hinting support in freetype as well as an non-patented auto-hinter which seems to produce good results
2010-05-22 00:12:04	voed	anybody has any idea, what libraries needs to be installed, in order to compile xdo.c ? Errors posted here >> http://pastebin.com/Jfx2RuR9
2010-05-22 00:18:15	Triskelios	voed: libX11 and most of the x11-proto headers, at the very least

2010-05-22 00:23:06	k4jcw	So if you copy a font over from another machine, how do you regenerate the fonts.dir and friends files?
2010-05-22 00:23:50	alanc	with mkfontscale & mkfontdir
2010-05-22 00:24:41	Triskelios	fonts.dir/scale is largely irrelevant these days
2010-05-22 00:26:23	alanc	that too
2010-05-22 00:28:10	k4jcw	I see the man pages and such for these, but why can they never provide an example of the usage?
2010-05-22 00:32:25	alanc	because most X developers are more interested in (and better at) writing software than writing docs, and few people volunteer to help make the docs better
2010-05-22 00:32:53	alanc	plus, as Trisk said, fonts.dir/scale aren't used much any more, so there's little interest in improving their docs
2010-05-22 00:32:54	k4jcw	I know, I know.  I've written FLOSS software for a long time.
2010-05-22 00:33:09	k4jcw	It's always a source of frustration.
2010-05-22 00:34:49	k4jcw	The worst part is all the wonderfully out-of-date docs.  I *really* don't care how X worked in 1997.
2010-05-22 00:35:02	k4jcw	s/docs/web pages/ rather
2010-05-22 00:35:12	dark	k4jcw, hmm. o.o
2010-05-22 00:35:35	dark	i find floss documentation, sometimes, *way* better than proprietary docs
2010-05-22 00:35:44	dark	but only sometimes :)
2010-05-22 00:37:47	alanc	some parts of X really haven't changed since 1997 though
2010-05-22 00:38:30	alanc	other parts, well, I regularly stumble across out-of-date things to fix in the docs, and try to fix some when I can
2010-05-22 00:43:37	k4jcw	Foo.  For some reason, KDE's font viewer won't open any TTF font, regardless of where it came from.
