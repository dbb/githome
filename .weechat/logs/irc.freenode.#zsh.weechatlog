2010-05-16 17:59:12	dbbolton	i am having trouble with a function that i want to use to set a variable to be used in my prompt
2010-05-16 18:00:26	dbbolton	http://paste.debian.net/73533/
2010-05-16 18:00:48	dbbolton	$DIRCOUNT shows up as a null string in my prompt
2010-05-16 18:06:04	rudi_s	dbbolton: Why do you define a zle function for that? Why not just use a precmd() function to build your prompt?
2010-05-16 18:12:27	dbbolton	because it needs to be updated every time the user uses cd
2010-05-16 18:12:48	Nomexous	cdpwd () { ... }
2010-05-16 18:13:54	rudi_s	And either set it directly in cdpwd (i.e. update the PROMPT there) or use promptsubst and use the variable in your prompt.
2010-05-16 18:14:58	dbbolton	would i call cdpwd before or after my setprompt function?

2010-05-16 18:16:51	rudi_s	dbbolton: It's called chpwd (not cdpwd) and automatically called whenever the user changes the directory.
2010-05-16 18:17:20	rudi_s	So you don't have to call it, zsh does it for you.
2010-05-16 18:18:45	Nomexous	http://paste.debian.net/73535/
2010-05-16 18:19:14	Nomexous	That's roughly what rudi_s suggested.
2010-05-16 18:19:43	Nomexous	I replaced the `ls . | wc -l` with something more zsh-friendly.
2010-05-16 18:20:32	dbbolton	does your version include directories in the count?
2010-05-16 18:20:41	Nomexous	Yes.

2010-05-16 18:22:43	Nomexous	No problem.
2010-05-16 18:23:58	dbbolton	in order to have this variable set when i log in, can i just add those 3 LOC to somewhere outside the chpwd block?
2010-05-16 18:24:33	Nomexous	Yeah.
2010-05-16 18:24:54	Nomexous	I guess chpwd isn't called on login.
2010-05-16 18:24:58	Nomexous	Which makes sense.
2010-05-16 18:25:39	rudi_s	dbbolton: Or you could call it manually from your zshrc (nor sure if it works though).
2010-05-16 18:26:04	Nomexous	I think you should go with rudi_s's suggestion.
2010-05-16 18:28:16	dbbolton	ok
2010-05-16 18:40:18	dbbolton	where can i find a list of the names of keys for use with bindkey?

2010-06-14 06:18:57	Mikachu	so the first ' is matched by the ' before string
2010-06-14 06:19:10	Mikachu	then the second \' is escaped, and the " 2 chars from the end stards a dquote
2010-06-14 06:19:36	Mikachu	you need 'print "'\''string'\''"'
2010-06-14 06:19:46	dbbolton	if i escape a double quote mark, it works.

2011-03-10 16:47:20	Mikachu	veilig_abt: is this directory always the same name but in different directories?
2011-03-10 16:47:54	veilig_abt	Mikachu:  yes, and I could be 3 directories beneath it or 5 or whatever
2011-03-10 16:48:13	Mikachu	veilig_abt: what i mean is if the directory you want to go to is not the same one
2011-03-10 16:48:17	Mikachu	not if you are in different places
2011-03-10 16:48:24	veilig_abt	I'm thinking a simple script that just searches back up till it finds it, then cd's me there
2011-03-10 16:48:32	Mikachu	ie is there /foo/directory/where/you/are and /bar/directory/where/you/are ?
2011-03-10 16:48:47	veilig_abt	oh, no...I know about that trick
2011-03-10 16:48:51	veilig_abt	cd foo bar
2011-03-10 16:49:08	Mikachu	that's not what i meant
2011-03-10 16:49:33	Mikachu	you want to go to /foo/directory but you're in /foo/directory/where/you/are
2011-03-10 16:49:42	Mikachu	and is there also the same situation but bar instead of foo sometimes?
2011-03-10 16:49:49	Mikachu	i don't understand your problem yet
2011-03-10 16:50:44	veilig_abt	ok, say I'm in /foo/dir/where/I/am/at, and I want to quickly go back to /foo/ so I can traverse down into /foo/a/new/place/i/want/to/go
2011-03-10 16:50:51	Mikachu	right
2011-03-10 16:51:09	Mikachu	so just say hash -d foo=/foo
2011-03-10 16:51:14	Mikachu	then you can cd ~foo/a/new/blabla
2011-03-10 16:51:25	Mikachu	my question is whether foo is always the same absolute directory
2011-03-10 16:51:30	Mikachu	or just a common name that can appear in various places
2011-03-10 16:51:40	veilig_abt	just a common name in various places
2011-03-10 16:52:27	Mikachu	ah
2011-03-10 16:52:43	Mikachu	so you don't want to create a bunch of ~foo1 ~foo2 etc
2011-03-10 16:52:53	Mikachu	hmm
2011-03-10 16:52:54	veilig_abt	not ideally.
2011-03-10 16:52:57	Mikachu	i think i solved this problem once already
2011-03-10 16:53:02	Mikachu	hold on while i search
2011-03-10 16:53:08	veilig_abt	ok - thanks
2011-03-10 16:53:29	Mikachu	zsh_directory_name () { [[ $1 != n ]] && return 1; reply=( (../)##$2([1]) ) }
2011-03-10 16:53:44	Mikachu	cd ~[foo]/a/new/blabla
2011-03-10 16:53:51	Mikachu	or just cd ~[a]/new/blabla should work too
2011-03-10 16:54:00	Mikachu	it requires a new-ish zsh though
2011-03-10 16:54:45	veilig_abt	ok - I'll take a look at this - it might be what I need! thanks for your help!

2011-03-10 16:55:16	Mikachu	not really much to look at, just try it, it should do what you wanted :P
2011-03-10 16:55:30	Mikachu	it adds as many ../ as needed to find the name given
2011-03-10 16:55:47	Mikachu	which isn't exactly what you wanted, but it will have the same result
2011-03-10 16:57:11	veilig_abt	ah yes
2011-03-10 16:57:14	veilig_abt	nice
2011-03-10 16:57:27	veilig_abt	this will do
2011-03-10 16:57:44	Mikachu	feel free to make it look for $2 in $PWD instead
2011-03-10 16:58:27	Mikachu	you can theoretically add completion too
2011-03-10 16:58:35	Mikachu	so that ~[f<tab> would give you ~[foo] directly
2011-03-10 16:58:57	veilig_abt	is there anyway to make it work w/out the [foo]?  just ~foo ?  or would that be a bad approach?
2011-03-10 16:58:58	Mikachu	should be pretty easy actually
2011-03-10 16:59:14	Mikachu	no, the whole feature is the ~[] syntax

2011-08-06 15:14:34	dbb0	why can't i print an interpolated string that starts with a hyphen
2011-08-06 15:15:53	thrig	foo=-asdf; print - $foo
2011-08-06 15:35:16	darthlukan	thrig: foo='-asdf'; print - $foo   ?
2011-08-06 15:35:30	nyuszika7h	You need to escape the hyphen inside single quotes, too...
2011-08-06 15:35:32	nyuszika7h	Weird.
2011-08-06 15:35:47	darthlukan	at least I was close :P
2011-08-06 15:36:01	thrig	not weird at all
2011-08-06 15:36:08	nyuszika7h	Really?
2011-08-06 15:36:24	Mikachu	you don't need to escape hypens, ever
2011-08-06 15:36:27	thrig	what does interpolation have to do with option processing?
2011-08-06 15:36:38	Mikachu	well, that's a lie, but in zsh you don't

2011-08-06 17:45:35	yac	i'd guess there is an env var for it
2011-08-06 17:47:32	uwjesd	Then you are almost as far as I am. I already guessed that there should be some mechanisms.
2011-08-06 17:47:52	yac	anyway, im using a symlink
2011-08-06 17:48:12	yac	did not need to bother to look for a better way
