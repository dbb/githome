2010-09-09 01:21:33	dbbolton	hey nadir
2010-09-09 01:22:02	nadir	oh, hello.
2010-09-09 01:22:13	nadir	nice you did hear me.
2010-09-09 01:22:15	dbbolton	just got your msg 
2010-09-09 01:22:21	nadir	thats good.
2010-09-09 01:22:36	nadir	bit of small talk or straight to the hot stuff?
2010-09-09 01:23:30	dbbolton	whatever floats your boat
2010-09-09 01:24:04	nadir	ok. i assume you are ok, the weather is good and the family is fine....
2010-09-09 01:24:13	nadir	I got a repo at github.
2010-09-09 01:24:26	nadir	at one PC i do my work, once it is done i push it to github.
2010-09-09 01:24:32	nadir	ok, so far?
2010-09-09 01:25:51	nadir	command is "git push origin master"
2010-09-09 01:26:17	dbbolton	yeah
2010-09-09 01:26:20	nadir	ok.
2010-09-09 01:26:32	dbbolton	you need to have the right key or whatever it's called
2010-09-09 01:26:40	nadir	NOw i am on PC 2 (it comes with BSD, but i don't think it matters" )
2010-09-09 01:26:50	nadir	wait a sec, then i will check "key or whatever"
2010-09-09 01:26:53	dbbolton	so the repo knows that the other computer is authorised to push to it
2010-09-09 01:27:04	nadir	nah, that is not the problem, a sec.
2010-09-09 01:27:17	nadir	I seem to have made changes on PC2's git.
2010-09-09 01:27:22	nadir	If i now do:
2010-09-09 01:27:30	nadir	"git pull origin master" i get a
2010-09-09 01:27:52	nadir	You are in the middle of a conflicted merge.
2010-09-09 01:28:14	nadir	All i want is this "version" to be the same like the one at github is atm.
2010-09-09 01:28:17	nadir	you got me?
2010-09-09 01:28:31	dbbolton	did you click on "edit" on the github web interface
2010-09-09 01:28:42	nadir	no. Should i?
2010-09-09 01:28:47	dbbolton	no
2010-09-09 01:28:50	nadir	good.
2010-09-09 01:28:57	dbbolton	i did that one time and go a similar error
2010-09-09 01:29:27	nadir	mhh...i think on this PC (2) i want to do:
2010-09-09 01:29:41	nadir	forget about everything and download the changes from github.
2010-09-09 01:30:14	dbbolton	clone?
2010-09-09 01:30:22	nadir	you think?
2010-09-09 01:30:43	nadir	i have thought that would be only for the initial one... ??
2010-09-09 01:31:10	dbbolton	clone means to take everything from the online repo and save it in the local dir
2010-09-09 01:31:41	nadir	sounds like exactly what i want.
2010-09-09 01:32:06	dbbolton	git clone git://github.com/username/reponame.git
2010-09-09 01:32:10	dbbolton	i believe
2010-09-09 01:32:19	nadir	ah, just wanted to ask that.
2010-09-09 01:32:29	nadir	i need to figure out the exact name at github.
2010-09-09 01:32:50	nadir	a sec
2010-09-09 01:34:46	nadir	if i run it inside of the git , named "backup_scripts" i get the same again.
2010-09-09 01:34:57	nadir	i will try it from the parent dir.
2010-09-09 01:36:38	dbbolton	you can clone from anywhere you have write permissions
2010-09-09 01:37:17	nadir	I don'T think that is the right way....
2010-09-09 01:37:28	nadir	if i do it from the git i get the same thing, once again.
2010-09-09 01:37:39	nadir	from the parent i would need to delete the old one first.
2010-09-09 01:37:54	nadir	that would be an akward way to do it, or not?
2010-09-09 01:38:10	dbbolton	you can rm -r ./.git
2010-09-09 01:38:26	nadir	are you sure?
2010-09-09 01:38:34	nadir	(cause i will run it...)
2010-09-09 01:38:48	dbbolton	you have every file at the version you want on the web, right?
2010-09-09 01:38:54	nadir	right
2010-09-09 01:38:54	dbbolton	and on the other computer?
2010-09-09 01:39:07	nadir	i haven'T been on this one for a while.
2010-09-09 01:39:14	nadir	i want it to be the same like the online one.
2010-09-09 01:39:18	dbbolton	right
2010-09-09 01:39:24	nadir	so i do:
2010-09-09 01:39:31	nadir	rm ./.git
2010-09-09 01:39:33	nadir	and then?
2010-09-09 01:39:36	dbbolton	go to the folder where you want the files to be
2010-09-09 01:39:46	dbbolton	and then rm the .git folder inside it
2010-09-09 01:39:59	nadir	ok, a sec (sweat....)
2010-09-09 01:40:56	nadir	ok, that is done.
2010-09-09 01:41:10	dbbolton	now clone
2010-09-09 01:41:25	nadir	from inside the folder again?
2010-09-09 01:41:35	dbbolton	the same folder where .git was
2010-09-09 01:41:55	dbbolton	it should be named the same as the git repo, but it isn't necessary
2010-09-09 01:42:15	nadir	That didn'T work.
2010-09-09 01:42:28	nadir	Now i am in the directory called: backup_scripts.
2010-09-09 01:42:28	dbbolton	what error msg did you get
2010-09-09 01:42:45	nadir	and there i got another directory (The git) called backup_scripts once again
2010-09-09 01:42:48	nadir	darn.
2010-09-09 01:43:12	dbbolton	ls backup_scripts

2010-09-09 01:43:46	nadir	sorry.
2010-09-09 01:43:47	nadir	 a sec.
2010-09-09 01:44:05	nadir	git://github.com/tornow/backup_scripts
2010-09-09 01:45:28	dbbolton	aren't those the files you want?
2010-09-09 01:45:51	nadir	See: There is my git called backup_scripts.
2010-09-09 01:46:09	nadir	The path is ~/la-la/Git/backup_scripts
2010-09-09 01:46:19	nadir	i go there and do clone git://la la
2010-09-09 01:46:22	nadir	and i get:
2010-09-09 01:46:40	dbbolton	so you have something like backup_scripts/backup_scripts/files.sh
2010-09-09 01:46:41	nadir	~/la-la/Git/backup_scripts/backup_scripts
2010-09-09 01:46:49	nadir	Yes.
2010-09-09 01:46:56	dbbolton	so
2010-09-09 01:47:08	dbbolton	cd ~/la-la/Git
2010-09-09 01:47:13	nadir	yes.
2010-09-09 01:47:19	dbbolton	rm -rf ./backup_scripts
2010-09-09 01:47:30	nadir	Well, ok, that would work.
2010-09-09 01:47:32	dbbolton	 git clone git://github.com/tornow/backup_scripts  
2010-09-09 01:47:38	nadir	yes, i got you.
2010-09-09 01:48:36	nadir	ok, case closed.
2010-09-09 01:48:42	nadir	(well: this case)
2010-09-09 01:49:04	dbbolton	i forgot that clone actually creates a new directory
2010-09-09 01:49:15	nadir	yes, i understood that.
2010-09-09 01:49:28	nadir	(i still think there could be a more sexy way).
2010-09-09 01:49:42	dbbolton	i don't really know much about git
2010-09-09 01:49:48	dbbolton	Telemachus probably does
2010-09-09 01:49:59	nadir	yeah, that might be.
2010-09-09 01:50:11	nadir	Seems like a world on its own: git.
2010-09-09 01:50:21	nadir	And the docu is very engineer like.
2010-09-09 01:50:27	dbbolton	yeah
2010-09-09 01:50:30	nadir	(no nice language...)
2010-09-09 01:50:36	dbbolton	it's pretty unbelievable 
2010-09-09 01:50:44	dbbolton	amazingly, CVS is even worse
2010-09-09 01:50:53	nadir	ha ha ha , hard to believe....
2010-09-09 01:51:14	nadir	At the moment i got my github, i edit my files and push them.
2010-09-09 01:51:25	nadir	That is all i am able to, and it already sucks.
2010-09-09 01:51:40	dbbolton	same here
2010-09-09 01:51:53	nadir	I had a look at your account (it is in your signature)
2010-09-09 01:51:59	nadir	some good stuff you got there.
2010-09-09 01:52:07	nadir	(but mainly Perl, yes?)
2010-09-09 01:52:45	dbbolton	it's almost all perl
2010-09-09 01:53:15	dbbolton	the icon ones are bash though 
2010-09-09 01:53:22	nadir	ok.
2010-09-09 01:53:26	nadir	Perl... argh....
2010-09-09 01:53:52	nadir	i was hoping to start with Python later this year... now all the cool people use Perl.
2010-09-09 01:53:55	nadir	OMG!
2010-09-09 01:54:11	dbbolton	actually i think Ruby is the cool new thing 
2010-09-09 01:54:19	dbbolton	i keep hearing more and more about it
2010-09-09 01:54:23	nadir	argh....
2010-09-09 01:54:48	nadir	Best might be to simply learn Bash, and "basta"
2010-09-09 01:55:11	dbbolton	what is basta
2010-09-09 01:55:27	nadir	mhhh... it is italian. But we often say so.
2010-09-09 01:55:40	nadir	kind of: "no more discussion, thoughts, etc about that"
2010-09-09 01:55:54	nadir	I don't know an english or german word for it.
2010-09-09 01:56:00	nadir	you got the idea?
2010-09-09 01:56:56	dbbolton	yeah
2010-09-09 01:57:10	nadir	ok, you got an english word for that?
2010-09-09 01:58:13	dbbolton	you could say "that's that"
2010-09-09 01:58:40	nadir	mhhh... i like basta better, but if no one knows it....
2010-09-09 01:59:05	dbbolton	you should look up Brainfuck programming
2010-09-09 01:59:24	nadir	wait a sec, i will make a note....on wood-paper.
2010-09-09 01:59:33	dbbolton	it makes C look natural language 
2010-09-09 02:00:01	nadir	ah! oh!
2010-09-09 02:00:09	nadir	now we talk.
2010-09-09 02:02:23	nadir	Oh, it is a language on its own?
2010-09-09 02:02:42	dbbolton	yeah
2010-09-09 02:03:06	dbbolton	the whole language syntax is only 8 characters
2010-09-09 02:03:13	nadir	lol.
2010-09-09 02:07:32	nadir	I willl add the question about the git in the forum.
2010-09-09 02:07:39	nadir	perhaps someone has got an idea...
2010-09-09 02:07:50	dbbolton	i'm sure 
2010-09-09 02:08:27	nadir	i am in the middle of bash-trouble, then Tele comes with this git-shit...
2010-09-09 02:08:29	nadir	ha ha ha
2010-09-09 02:09:03	nadir	My plans are:
2010-09-09 02:09:20	nadir	bash, regular-expression, sid and awk.
2010-09-09 02:10:46	dbbolton	lol, you could just learn perl and cover all of those at once
2010-09-09 02:11:02	nadir	argh....
2010-09-09 02:14:00	dbbolton	i need to go to sleep.. 02:13 here
2010-09-09 02:14:08	dbbolton	good luck with git 
2010-09-09 02:14:12	nadir	thats, fine,
2010-09-09 02:14:13	dbbolton	you'll need it
2010-09-09 02:14:16	nadir	thanks for your help.
2010-09-09 02:14:20	nadir	ha ha , yes.
2010-09-09 02:14:24	nadir	bye, thanks again.
2010-09-09 02:14:41	dbbolton	no problem
2010-09-09 02:14:43	dbbolton	later

2010-11-28 07:51:51	nadir	We could have needed your help yesterday, telemachus.
2010-11-28 07:51:59	nadir	lots of troubles with git :-)
2010-11-28 07:55:41	telemachus	umph
2010-11-28 07:55:44	telemachus	sorry to hear it
2010-11-28 07:55:56	telemachus	did you settle them or just shoot git?
2010-11-28 07:56:03	nadir	I think we got it sorted.
2010-11-28 07:56:08	telemachus	good
2010-11-28 07:56:11	telemachus	:)
2010-11-28 07:56:11	nadir	about forking.
2010-11-28 07:56:14	nadir	yes, good.
2010-11-28 07:56:27	nadir	you got my/our memo about btree?
2010-11-28 07:56:41	nadir	if not, check: ./btree -h | less
2010-11-28 07:56:44	telemachus	btree -h | less you mean?
2010-11-28 07:56:48	telemachus	got it
2010-11-28 07:56:49	nadir	yup
2010-11-28 07:56:53	nadir	and?
2010-11-28 07:56:56	telemachus	that puts the man page into a pager
2010-11-28 07:57:01	nadir	bug or feature?
2010-11-28 07:57:07	telemachus	heh
2010-11-28 07:57:09	telemachus	not sure
2010-11-28 07:57:26	nadir	fsmith figured out that " l less -r " kinda solves it.
2010-11-28 07:57:35	telemachus	I've thought of it, but I then have to pick which pager, yadda yadda, blah blah
2010-11-28 07:57:41	telemachus	oh, wait
2010-11-28 07:57:42	telemachus	huh?
2010-11-28 07:58:07	nadir	what huh? huh yadda yadda or huh blah blah? :-)
2010-11-28 07:58:43	telemachus	What do you think I will see when I do btree -h | less?
2010-11-28 07:59:17	nadir	a lot of weird signs.
2010-11-28 07:59:26	telemachus	ah
2010-11-28 07:59:27	telemachus	no
2010-11-28 07:59:29	nadir	don't ask me about how the correct name for it is.
2010-11-28 07:59:29	telemachus	I don't
2010-11-28 07:59:40	nadir	shall i upload a shot?
2010-11-28 07:59:53	telemachus	no, I know what you mean now
2010-11-28 07:59:59	telemachus	I have this in my .bashrc
2010-11-28 08:00:00	nadir	it is all the stuff which is set in the first few vars, i guess.
2010-11-28 08:00:01	telemachus	LESS='-GRJx4P?f[%f]:[STDIN].?pB - [%pB\%]:\.\.\..'
2010-11-28 08:00:14	nadir	omg.
2010-11-28 08:00:15	telemachus	it makes my pager handle stuff like that (among other things)
2010-11-28 08:00:18	nadir	let me try that.
2010-11-28 08:00:35	nadir	yes? or is it BullShitDragon stuff?
2010-11-28 08:00:44	telemachus	try it

2010-11-28 08:01:27	telemachus	First hit
2010-11-28 08:01:29	telemachus	hah!
2010-11-28 08:01:33	telemachus	Google-fu
2010-11-28 08:01:46	nadir	nope, got a heck lot of ESC signs now.
2010-11-28 08:02:11	nadir	SC[1mNAMEESC[0m
2010-11-28 08:02:32	nadir	but yur google-fu is impressing.
2010-11-28 08:03:13	telemachus	nadir: Do the LESS=stuff
2010-11-28 08:03:14	telemachus	then
2010-11-28 08:03:17	telemachus	export LESS
2010-11-28 08:03:20	telemachus	then resource .bashrc
2010-11-28 08:03:22	nadir	ah, shit.
2010-11-28 08:03:38	telemachus	LESS='-GRJx4P?f[%f]:[STDIN].?pB - [%pB\%]:\.\.\..'
2010-11-28 08:03:39	telemachus	export LESS
2010-11-28 08:04:32	nadir	voila.
2010-11-28 08:04:38	nadir	all sexy now.
2010-11-28 08:04:49	nadir	but how do i make that permanent?
2010-11-28 08:04:52	telemachus	cool
2010-11-28 08:04:56	nadir	yeah, cool.
2010-11-28 08:04:57	telemachus	is that in your .bashrc?
2010-11-28 08:04:59	nadir	yes.
2010-11-28 08:05:04	telemachus	then it's permanent
2010-11-28 08:05:08	nadir	but i don't think i got LESS in my env
2010-11-28 08:05:15	telemachus	every time you get a new shell the settings will be exported
2010-11-28 08:05:30	telemachus	LESS is automatically picked up by less I believe
2010-11-28 08:05:35	nadir	but why didn't source .bashrc help then?
2010-11-28 08:05:43	telemachus	that is, the pager picks up the environment variable
2010-11-28 08:05:46	telemachus	has to be exported
2010-11-28 08:05:51	nadir	ah, ok.
2010-11-28 08:06:39	nadir	what does:
2010-11-28 08:06:54	nadir	printf "%b yabba-dabba" do?
2010-11-28 08:06:55	nadir	the b
2010-11-28 08:07:27	telemachus	the %b is a special formatter for Bash
2010-11-28 08:07:42	telemachus	it causes Bash to process those special ANSI color settings
2010-11-28 08:07:55	telemachus	long story short, it allows me to easily give color to parts of what I print
2010-11-28 08:08:08	telemachus	see help printf
2010-11-28 08:08:28	telemachus	    In addition to the standard format specifications described in printf(1)
2010-11-28 08:08:31	telemachus	    and printf(3), printf interprets:
2010-11-28 08:08:36	telemachus	      %b	expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding argument
2010-11-28 08:08:39	telemachus	      %q	quote the argument in a way that can be reused as shell input
2010-11-28 08:08:52	nadir	that far we already got. Is that chinese?
2010-11-28 08:09:00	telemachus	huh?
2010-11-28 08:09:15	nadir	plain: it says nothign to me, and to my bash-brother neither.
2010-11-28 08:09:21	telemachus	You mean...ah, k
2010-11-28 08:12:31	telemachus	"backslash escape sequences" means fancy stuff using \ :)
2010-11-28 08:12:58	telemachus	it includes things like \a (ring a bell), but also the ANSI color escapes that many people use in prompts
2010-11-28 08:13:16	telemachus	http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#ANSI_002dC-Quoting
2010-11-28 08:15:19	nadir	Ok, i got an idea:
2010-11-28 08:15:23	nadir	    printf "%b [-h|--help|-?] [-C] [-L num] [directory ...]\n"\
2010-11-28 08:15:23	nadir	        "$bold${0##*/}$end"
2010-11-28 08:15:26	nadir	...
2010-11-28 08:15:31	nadir	without the "%b
2010-11-28 08:15:43	nadir	the bold and the end would need to be escabed?
2010-11-28 08:15:44	telemachus	exactly
2010-11-28 08:15:48	telemachus	with the $b
2010-11-28 08:15:51	telemachus	no they wouldn't work
2010-11-28 08:16:06	telemachus	or would require a lot of fiddling/twiddling and then most likeley not work
2010-11-28 08:26:16	telemachus	so, yeah, that's %b
2010-11-28 08:26:42	nadir	i removed it and no "blocked" output, so i guess i got it.
2010-11-28 08:26:53	nadir	(not really, but a part of it)
2010-11-28 08:27:01	telemachus	hmm?
2010-11-28 08:27:09	nadir	i did:
2010-11-28 08:27:27	nadir	printf " [-h| and so on bold/end"
2010-11-28 08:27:30	nadir	then:
2010-11-28 08:27:34	nadir	./btree -l
2010-11-28 08:27:36	nadir	and:
2010-11-28 08:27:58	nadir	no bold: btree at the beginning of the line.
2010-11-28 08:28:09	nadir	i insertedt the "%b" again.
2010-11-28 08:28:21	nadir	same command: bold "btree info-info-info"
2010-11-28 08:28:30	telemachus	ah, ok
2010-11-28 08:28:53	nadir	I am not good in seeing bold or not bold, blue or green, underlined or not.
2010-11-28 08:29:06	nadir	so : i missed the difference when i ran that test yesterday.
2010-11-28 08:29:24	telemachus	ah, ok
2010-11-28 08:29:31	<--	smv (smv@78.96.254.209) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2010-11-28 08:29:36	telemachus	I could write an alternative version without all the formatting
2010-11-28 08:29:38	telemachus	if you want
2010-11-28 08:29:49	nadir	honestly: that would be very cool.
2010-11-28 08:30:01	nadir	for one reason: i don't understand the code the way it is now.
2010-11-28 08:30:07	telemachus	and also no colors?
2010-11-28 08:30:09	nadir	i jump back and forth, and get fuzzy.
2010-11-28 08:30:23	nadir	the most raw-version possible would be cool.
2010-11-28 08:30:29	telemachus	k
2010-11-28 08:30:34	nadir	so i can start at an easy point, and make my way up.
2010-11-28 08:30:37	telemachus	I won't get to it right this minute, but later today
2010-11-28 08:30:55	nadir	dosna need to be today. sometimes. I got enough learning projects.
2010-11-28 08:31:01	telemachus	heh
2010-11-28 08:31:02	telemachus	k
2010-11-28 08:31:15	nadir	Chrismas present ?
2010-11-28 08:31:26	nadir	the rewritten btree for nadir...
2010-11-28 08:31:37	telemachus	hah
2010-11-28 08:31:38	telemachus	ok
2010-11-28 08:31:39	telemachus	easy
2010-11-28 08:31:46	telemachus	in fact, early enough for hanukkah
2010-11-28 08:31:50	telemachus	(next wed)
2010-11-28 08:31:51	telemachus	easy
