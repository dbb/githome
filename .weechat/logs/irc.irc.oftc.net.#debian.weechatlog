2009-12-26 08:09:23	melsonmore	You can get a netinst iso thats only about 149MB.
2009-12-26 08:09:28	babilen	somdev: you can download the 'netinstall' image and burn it yourself
2009-12-26 08:10:23	babilen	somdev: that rewuires you to have a working network connection while you install though, if you want to install anything like Gnome, KDE, or so. You can also download CD1/DVD1 which contains more packages
2009-12-26 08:10:29	babilen	!netinstall
2009-12-26 08:10:30	dpkg	extra, extra, read all about it, netinst is a small CD image with which you can install Debian.  If, during the installation process you have a working Internet connection, you can install more packages straight away, otherwise, you will have a base install and more packages later.  See http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/  See also <check iso image>, <dialup install>, <usb install>, <pppoe install>, <netboot>, <bf>, <installer>.

For other Java programs, you can install the default-jre package to get a Java runtime; use "apt-cache search java-virtual-machine" to see other implementations.  The best options are probably openjdk-6-jre or sun-java6-jre (non-free).  See also <java alternatives>.
