2010-05-17 19:35:08	--	- called cyberpunk. William Gibson defined the word cyberspace,

2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- the early 1980s he wrote Neuromancer, and with this novel he
2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- helped establish a new kind of science fiction literature
2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- called cyberpunk. William Gibson defined the word cyberspace,
2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- and described virtual reality long before we saw the
2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- similarities with todays Internet. He has won the Hugo Award,
2010-07-02 21:47:58	--	- Nebula Award and the Philipp K. Dick Award.
