## Description

This repo is a collection of various config files and some shell scripts I use to manage them. I'm not brave enough to turn my ~ into a fully-fledged git repository, so I use this as a bit of misdirection to manage my application settings on multiple machines.

Do not even pretend like anything in here could be useful to you.
